'Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity.'
â€” Charles Mingus
'Cognitive scientists have discovered three important features of the human information processing system that are particularly relevant for PowerPoint users: dual-channels, that is, people have separate information processing channels for visual material and verbal material; limited capacity, that is, people can pay attention to only a few pieces of information in each channel at a time; and active processing, that is, people understand the presented material when they pay attention to the relevant material, organize it into a coherent mental structure, and integrate it with their prior knowledge.'
â€” Rich Mayer, in an interview with Sociable Media, Inc.

# 'The best solution to visual dispay of multivariate data is using small multiples' - Eduard Tufte paraphrase

--

### Small multiple:  One method Tufte encourages to allow quick visual comparison of multiple series is the small multiple, a chart with many series shown on a single pair of axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other. He suggests this is particularly helpful when the series are measured on quite different vertical (y-axis) scales, but over the same range on the horizontal x-axis (usually time) - wikipedia

# Fluid plotting/storytelling w/ ggplot2

Hadley Wickham, ggplot2 author on it's motivation:

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable. 

--

> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved,


---

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just wanted to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.* 

--

> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and ... I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

# give decisions full voice. Move slowly and with intention.  +1 for + aes() editorializing as usual.

# ggplot2 is called a 'declarative' graphing system.

# It lets you *'speak your plot into existence'*. (Thomas Lin Pederson?)
