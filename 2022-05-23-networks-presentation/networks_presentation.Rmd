### Is my network cohesive? Is it "dense"?

###  Are there important individuals within the network?

###  Are there communities within the network?

###  If I see fissure in the network, along what lines might I expect to see that?

### "Mapping Networks of Terrorist Cells" Valdis E. Krebs

### *This paper looks at the difficulty in mapping covert networks. Analyzing networks after an event is fairly easy for prosecution purposes. Mapping covert networks to prevent criminal activity is much more difficult. We examine the network surrounding the tragic events of September 11th, 2001. Through public data we are able to map a portion of the network centered around the 19 dead hijackers. *

# Krebs Questions...

--

### What type of layout does it seem like Krebs is using? Is it force directed, or some geometric layout like circle or sphere?

--

### Also look at Table 3.  What has been calculated in this table?  What do you think these calculations try to measure/capture about the individuals?

## Betweenness Centrality

#### Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.

--

#### take each pair of nodes in a network

--

#### identify the shortest path between them

--

#### for each node in the network count the number of time it is an "on-the-way" nodes

## Networks Evolution

- Compare the COW defense alliance network of 1939 with that of 2012. How are they different?

--

- Then look at the alliance network of a single country - maybe Russia

- Now switch between "star" and "ego"  What do you thin an "ego network" is?

```



#### Today we discussed `r aeiou("relational data and its analysis.")`  We was that there has been increased usage in the term `r aeiou("Network Visualization")` in `r aeiou("Google's ngram viewer")` &ndash; usage has been skyrocketing. Then we talked about network data structure, using the classic `r aeiou("Zachary's Karate Club")` data set as an example.   Raw network data is composed of about `r aeiou("edge lists")`, and `r aeiou("nodes lists")`.  

#### We also explored a number of network visualization `r aeiou("layouts")`.  A couple of `r aeiou("force-directed")` layouts were the Fructerman-Reingold and Kamada Kawai &ndash; different algorithms based on physical models that balancing `r aeiou("attractive")` and `r aeiou("rupulsive forces")` -- you might think of a the edges as a set of springs. These force-derected layouts contrast with geometric layouts like the `r aeiou("circle")` or `r aeiou("sphere")` or the `r aeiou("random")` layouts.

---

####  We then had a look at Krebs 2002, "Mapping Networks of Terrorist Cells".  His choice of layout seemed to be a `r aeiou("force-directed")` one.  He calculated centrality measures calculated and decoration on the 9-11 terrorist network. The simplest measure was *degree* centrality -- which calculates "incidence upon" -- just the number of connections to the node.  The other two were `r aeiou("closeness")` centrality and `r aeiou("betweenness")`. 

#### We actually calculated characteristics of our node too measures too &ndash; `r aeiou("centrality")` measures for our network example. 

#### Sometimes, network visualizations are `r aeiou("decorated")` with variation in `r aeiou("aesthetics")` (colors, shapes, size) that represent these characteristics (line width or line type is typical for the edge list). We had size of nodes represent centrality measures in our network visualization.  

---

####  Finally, we talked about another paradigm in analysing relational data -- the `r aeiou("dyadic")` paradigm, which has been the framework for much work coming out of the Correlates of War (COW) project.  Here we learned about the concept of `r aeiou("dyadic")` data and analysis, and that paradigm has been challanged, especially by expert of network analysis, but that dyadic structure is suited to `r aeiou("regression analysis")`.

#### Exploring the COW `r aeiou("Alliance")` data set, we saw the evolution in the set of alliances in the online app, and the star and `r aeiou("ego")` graph.  Dr. Reynolds also talked about the `r aeiou("bipartite")` networks &ndash; which capture association.  It is helpful to visualize the `r aeiou("bipartite")` --- the alliances organizations as nodes to avoid the so-called `r aeiou("hairball")` graph.  

#### Network analysis is promising as a tool for study of a wide variety of *issues areas* and is complementary to other *analysis specialization* including text and spatial analysis.
