# Who are the ggplot2 extenders? And how to become one?

---

# What does extension promise?

What does ggplot2 give us?

ggplot2 give us intuitive, composible interface for plotting.

'Speak your plot into existence'


---

And extension: More of the same.

'extension allows fluid ggplot2-consistent syntax in domains that base ggplot2 doesn't handle.' 

(you almost *don't need to look at documentation* 🥹). Well-written extensions will be aligned with ggplot2 syntax and afford applying that already-learned knowledge.

'Speak your ('diverging bar chart/bump chart/circlepacking chart') into existence'


---

# But ggplot2 extension is ...


'not for the faint of heart'. 💔  2X

Epic journey to extension

1. 💪 kind of effortful plotting with base ggplot2
2. 🗡🛡⛔️ *valient* effort to produce an extensions (bravery)
3. 👶 plotting with the extensions (woohoo!) - child's play


---

How can something that is *so useful* be out of reach for *so many*? 😭

'ggplot2 extenders is *such* an exclusive club' - 2022

---

'Draw anything with ggplot2.'

'Draw anything with ggplot2 - without loosing your mind 🧠' 






---

# Super extenders

-- Show production...



---

# Super extenders... 

1. something happens, and adding extension doesn't feel effort-ful, and they see extension opportunities everywhere...

1. 💪 kind of effortful plotting with base ggplot2 
2. 🧠 focused attention and effort (not bravery)
3. 👶 plotting with the extensions (woohoo!) - child's play



---

# What if we worked on this

From 🗡🛡⛔️ *valient* effort to produce an extensions (bravery)

To 🧠 focused attention and effort (not bravery) 

from the start..

- Can we lower the barriers to entry?

Educational materials... 
As step by step as possible...  
With accessible examples.

Easy Geom Recipes

```{r, eval = F}


```


```{r}
library(ggram)
library(tidyverse)
compute_group_means <- function(data, scales){
  
  data |>
    summarize(x = mean(x),
              y = mean(y))
  
}

cars |> 
  select(x = speed, y = dist) |> 
  compute_group_means()


ggram_df_output("Step 1: Define compute")
```


```{r}
StatMeans <- 
  ggproto(`_class` = "StatMeans",
          `_inherit` = Stat,
          compute_group = 
            compute_group_means)
#'
#'
ggplot(cars) + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(stat = StatMeans, 
             size = 8)

ggram("Step 2: Define Stat and Test", widths = c(1, .7))

```

- when there are inevitable roadblocks, surprises, etc can we provide a safety net? 

# Who are the ggplot2 extenders? 

COWY-2023: 'We have a support group for that' 

COWY-2025: 'We have a support group for that... growing in numbers, video recordings, double digit attendees, active discussion board, our first COWY attendee, social media presence, Posit supported, testimonials'

---

2023 - small group of extenders

2025 - group of extenders and extension-interested


---

# Extension competencies

How can something that is *so useful* be commanded by *so few*? 😭

- domain specific expertise

--

- knowing that extension is possible
- extension mechanisms education
- packaging know-how
- packaging know how specific to ggplot2


Extender unicorns... Maybe AI aleviates some of this...  Or maybe community.
