Thanks for joining!  

This flipbook will look at the topic of fine-tuned aesthetic evaluation using after_stat, after_scale, and stage.  

Are you the type of person that learned ggplot2 before these mechanisms were put together, and just ignore them (that's me!) 

--

This book is for you!

---

Are you the kind of person that can copy and paste after_stat, after_scale, and stage code but really has no idea what's going on? (that'd be me if I actually used the mechanisms)

--

This book is for you!

---

Are you the kind of person that admires really beautifully and thoughtfully crafted data vizualizations, and have noticed the authors use of after_stat, after_scale, and stage, but have thought, I'm not sure it's worth all the fuss.

This book is for you!





The source material is basically an expansion of https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html
