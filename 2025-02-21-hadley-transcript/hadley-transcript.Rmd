Hadley's thoughts on the ggplot2 ecosystem
everyone uh I did not really prepare anything today but I can uh and I feel
like I don't really know about I mean Thomas Thomas and ton are on the call and they both know far more about gigot
extensions uh than me but I thought I could like talk a little bit about the
the history uh and what my more memory is of that
history and um then like answer any questions youall might
have I think it I think it really was Thomas who got the extensions ecosystem
started is that ring a bell to you Thomas I think so yeah I I I I think I
wrote a blog post about it once after my first internship um you made a lot of
the stuff extensible like initially right you did the PO requests
yeah the facets here but I also think that uh my inability to extend it in the
first place spurred you to the whole G Proto rewrite but that is uh speculation
but the timing lines up that makes sense yeah I forgot about go GG Pro the
objectoriented programming system used by only one package and was
descendants um that's one of my many many crimes against object HED
programming and half um yeah like it was sort of interesting
like I guess that was the time around the time where I think like
GG plot 2 was kind of really taking off popularity and until that point in time
I'd been like really hands on with ggplot 2 like basically kind of my goal
when ggplot 2 was starting off was like when anyone said anything about gplot 2
anywhere on the internet I would be there uh and I had like back in the day
you could like subscribe to a search on Google so it would email you when anyone
ever mentioned gigot 2 and so if like anyone said anything bad about it I'd be
like there being like hey like I'm a developer like is there something I can do to make this better for you um and
was really active on our help and it's there as well but it became like pretty clear pretty quickly like that was
unsustainable and like I just could not continue doing that um and so around
that time like that was sort of in the more of the era of mailing this it was a pretty big ggplot 2 mailing list at the
time where I had kind of been like if anyone answers a question I will answer it and so then I also at that time I
said like I'm not going to do that anymore uh like I can't do that anymore
and like please other people in the community step forward and I think that
was like one of the experiences that was like really kind of transformative for me in general in terms of like I'm not
not terribly good at like giving up control of stuff or responsibility of
stuff but doing that with the ggplot 2 mailing list like I stopped answering questions and it actually like created a
lot of space for other people to like step in and answer questions and contribute and learn and
grow and I think that's kind of around the time that the sort of the extensions um started picking
up or there started to be some ecosystem um I don't know when was the I
don't even remember when the Dig 2 extensions website um
got started that's some time after pretty
sometime yeah because who who did that
initially uh was it was it Daniel yeah
no I have forgotten the name that wasar for
this because there's also the relative
Infamous accidental like the domain name for the gigot to extensions expired and
it got purchased by like a Russian B
site so there was a brief brief period where like did you put two
extensions x.org was like Russian pornsite which I was kind of like like
like horrified by but also like that just seems like such a niche like
like how can you make money from that like how many people looking for gplot 2 extensions and now like oh I can't find
anything about gplot two extensions I'll just watch some P instead like it just seems like such a crazy business model
that but I guess they're just like look at you know some automated thing looking for expired domain names and and buying
up ones that have some modum of traffic um so I think that was kind of the
period we we like after that obviously I was like let's take this to under our that we control the domain name and this
uh never happens
again yeah and sort of so extension are kind of always one of the things I think in ggplot 2 like there's
stuff in there's a lot there quite a few things in ggplot 2 that I know like
really important and valuable and people like and care about but I have like
basically zero interest in I think like the extensions are kind of one of that
like like I I 100% believe that they're like super super valuable like incredibly valuable and the fact that
there's now like 130 plus ggp 2 extensions just seems
like crazy to me but it's equally something I'm just I'm just not interested in working on this um so
another like another thing that I know is also really important like the theming system in ggot too uh which is
hul on mostly contributed by Kos Takahashi um like again something like I
know is like really like I know it's really valuable but it's just so hard for me to like rustle up the enthusiasm
to like work work on that um so I think that that's kind of like the you know in
some ways now like the maturity of the plot 2 ecosystem is that it has like the
maintainership like passed from me to thas and then I mean really like Tom
from Thomas to to Yun uh and who knows what will happen
next but it seems like there's only like so many years that any one person can
maintain one package without getting getting bored of it but I've been thinking a little bit
um the GPT 2 is going to turn 18 in June
next year so I'm thinking about having like some kind of like gig pot to is
going to like college celebration next year about voting would be fun I could
vote yeah only it was a only it was a
citizen foring to buy a gun for quite a long time now especially in Texas
but yeah that's fine any so those are kind of like my sort of vague not very
put well put together thoughts about extensions but I'd love to you know just chat with your answer any questions you
might have subject to the the the whims
of my not terribly good memory
um well if you want to drop um questions in the in the chat um we can do that and
but I think we're a small enough group that we can just um take questions as they come if you want to raise your hand
um to to jump in that works um I guess I have a question to start
Q: Scope of extension packages
off with and I guess it's on and maybe it's like a little a little bit to Thomas I feel like
like um just like when you write an extension package like how do you figure
out what the scope should be so I think like there's some like really
like extension packages that are really focused I I was thinking like David's GG
bump comes to mind and it's like it's the G bump package and then there's G Force that's like what is in there it's
like it has so much um so I mean it's a question to everybody I think um that's
on this call to but how you should um you should weit
yeah I mean we we sort of think about this I think quite a lot like in the Tidy verse like what is the kind of
scope for a package and I really believe like it's it's valuable to keep a
package like fa scoped and Fa focused so there is like a scene to or two that
kind of captures the the spirit of that package um you know in some ways that
that's what like forced the gplot 2 extensions to exist it just stuff where I'm like this doesn't feel to me in my
heart of hearts like it belongs in gplot 2 like it like 100% should exist and be
on cran but just it doesn't feel to me like it's part of ggplot to so it's like finding that kind of like core idea and
sticking to it I think is really important I'm not sure like how I if I can like
really articulate like why I think that's so important but I think there's definitely
something about like if you want people to use your tool be able to find your tool it has to have some kind of
unifying cohesive theme and there's certainly like a space for like these kind of like MK packages where it's just
like a random collection of useful stuff but I think it's really hard for people to kind of like remember like you needs
to be some kind of concept in the head that that that that kind of sticks and they can grab on
to and Thomas if you wanted to chime in on that um yes you're absolutely true or um
it's absolutely true the GG Force is is like whatever sticks on the wall um I
also vividly remembered like starting that package when like the first version
of ggplot 2 that allowed extensions I was so excited and I was like if anyone
just have an idea and they don't want to maintain a package like this is the place to put it like let's just collect
a bunch um the good thing about like unfocused package is that you only
really need one because then that can kind of be a catch all for everything
that doesn't fit anywhere else so like there is no need for me to have more than gg4 and then a bunch of focused
extension packages because if I don't and I must say like development of gg4 has also slowed considerably down um
partly because there are so many of you that that makes extensions and I'm only
me um so there is no there's really no need for me to spend time like collecting all these various features
but it's also like I think it's true from headless what hadly say that as a
user you need like it's way easier to to start using a tool if the tool has like
a a cohesive story that it tells like what what can this solve for you for you
and and especially if it does it in a very cohesive way and it's very hard for
like packages that just collect random stuff to have a cohesive like idea
around them um but I can also feel that like I I really dread looking at gt4s
because it's just this bunch of stuff like like it's it's very hard as a developer to situate yourself into that
package once you like if you've been away for a year which I at least have
been from like like just opening that that project again it's just like oh I I
don't want to touch it like I'm sure it works there no need for me to to look at it um it's so much easier for Focus
packages is um to receive continued attention from the developer um so I think that that in
itself is a boon and and gives longivity to a package uh a tool so I I do believe
you you're giving yourself a great gift if if you kind of sit down and Define
what you want to do both because it's easier to sell to users but it's also easier to sell to yourself whilst
maintaining it but it is also like hard when you get started that you do just have like five
random functions that are useful to you and if there's no consistent theme between them like having five different
packages is not the solution either so like in some ways I do think these like Mis packages are
kind of like a like a natural a natural period in the life cycle of a package it
just sometimes takes you a while to figure out like what is the cohesive story and it's okay to have a m package
for a while that then you realize oh these 10 things are actually all instances of the same problem and I'm
going to move them into a package and now that I think about them and like rows and columns I can see like there's
bits missing here and here and fill out the whole whole SP whole problem
space so um David if you wanted to respond because I mentioned you and like
I feel like even the name like G bump you're kind of narrow to um to
thematically were you tempted to put random stuff in yeah but I started with a weird r
package called ablar abl which is my MK package for whatever I came up with and
and it was like GG Force it's just a random Bunch but uh but then I wanted I
found more enthusiasm doing very scoped things so bump shards for gplot that was
one extension and then G stream and then G sanki uh more like an intellectual
problem because they pretty complex plots stream stream plots and uh sanky
plots but that's why they really hard to maintain well I have two kids and it's
so hard to be so deep inside GG plot it takes at least two days just to get all
the information in your head again so I'm struggling with maintaining them but
um but it's it's really nice to have a really scul package I
agree and we good hear from um Corey and then
Cynthia yes I'm this is another question I guess if we're wrapping up the previous
Q: Various methods of extending ggplot2
question um I'm interested in uh the the maintainers is in particular thoughts on
the the range of um and I say I say this it's it's a value loaded term but I
don't mean it that way the range of fidelity with which extensions adhere to
the rigorous grammar of Graphics as originally put forth um the packages I'm
I'm aware that they range from extensions that are very meticulous with respect to their to like what the what
the Aesthetics refer to and what the the gumes are to these things that are sort of analogous to autoplot functions for
new data types and I think they're all very valuable ggplot 2 is wonderful for
the Aesthetics it brought as well as for the uh for the rigor um but that also
produces issues for example when you have different extensions that are not compatible with each other because they
don't sort of they don't adhere to the principles in the same way so um but that's just my own like one example of
what might arise out of that so do you have thoughts generally on
how how that what that what to make of that kind of
ecosystem I have thought well yeah Thomas probably has a lot of thoughts
based on his experience with r dip checks but you you go ahead thas yeah no
I I think um so there is an academic side to the question and then there is
the what do you feel as a maintainer side and and uh to tackle the the last
one first like um as long as the extension is well
behaved like as long as it is using the extension mechanism as it was intended
and communicated then everything goes like go wild go crazy and and solve the
problem that you're trying to solve um our biggest issue are um very creative
Developers that um that needs to solve a problem and and
does that by any cost and and of course that is great but um GPL 2 has so many
dependencies uh or reverse dependencies that like we cannot change a single sign
without breaking someone's code because someone is in there like grabbing stuff
they shouldn't uh pull out and using it in unintended ways and so on um and this is
this isound sounding very like please don't do that this is hurting my life
but it's it's more it's more around like the it is very tedious and it's very
slow process to actually update gdpl 2 and of of course gdpl 2 doesn't need
that much updating but but like we can at most make a release every year with
like with new changes in it because it it takes so much energy to go through
all the breaking packages that we break just because we're changing something that we should be allowed to change now
to the um to the academic side of it I I think it would be fantastic if if
everyone kind of uh took the ideas of
ggplot 2 and the grammar and kind of uh extended that right rather than than
like building high level functions on top of it because it it makes it way easier for things to
interact but I'm also like that's not going to fly like that's a pipe dream in some sense and sometimes
you need to solve a problem and and I'm fully like I need to do that as well and
I have certainly steered away from from reg grammar from time to time as well so
I I I totally get that that is needed sometimes but it would nice like if you it's better to be a bit more on the
side of the original API and and give up some fancy ideas that you had I think
rather than like throw it all in the bin and just like do crazy stuff um it's Al
also easier for the user because they don't have to like context switch between
extensions yeah I I know it's a complicated question like in some sense it feels to me like like a
success criteria for the ggplot to extending ecosystem is like people
creating things that I think are terrible ideas or like horrible like
that like that's a good thing right that's a sign of of strength that the the community is not just limited by my
my vision and my Aesthetics um in the not in the GD St
and in the like Visual and logs in so and there's also this this challenge of like
if you want to do something you want to extend gbot 2 in a way that's not been
done before or is not strictly allowed but you can figure out a way to kind of hack around it like should you do it or
not like on the one hand yes it's great like go ahead and like do it um but on
the other hand like if you're relying on a t of GP 2 there kind of like no gu
anes and then it does shift like the burden back to the maintainers of gbot 2
if something breaks like it's still feels like our responsibility because now you've got a bunch of people using
your package it's cly not their responsibility so yeah I don't know like
I think ideally like yes people should use the grammar as much as possible like it's a great you know obviously I a
great believer in that as a theory to to unify many types of graphics and if you
can frame what you're doing in terms of one of the existing components of the grammar that's like really powerful
because now it combines you know nicely with a bunch of existing stuff that people can use but there's also like
there is also a room like room for not just like grammars of Graphics but typologies of Graphics where you are
like you know in some domains there are you know like seven plots that everyone wants to do and if you can expose them
behind some kind of useful um frontend that requires list typing Or List
thinking or whatever that that seems valuable to me too um so I'm not and then you know on
top of that like I like most people writing our packages are not professional programmers not they not
even like if necessarily paid to do the project this is something they're doing like for fun and their free time and so
I feel like I just find it very hard to be like kind of tough on those people
like I kind of appreciate like whatever you can do is great and it does feel
like you know I think one of the one of the the things that like in return for
you know me and Thomas and tan being paid to work you PL to that means it's
our responsibility to take on like some of us pain from the community and suffer through it because it's better for us to
suffer than for everyone else to suffer um maybe maybe Thomas believes that less
since he's the one that's suffering during the ri checks and I'm I no longer have to suffer that but I think like I
you know I think we're all aligned and like we want to support the user Community we accept that like you know
we're full-time professional programmers which is pretty unusual in the our community and we want to do to what we
can do to support everyone you know get better and grow over
time um I think we could hear from Cynthia and then June and
Q: Transitions into and out of development
Joyce um thanks I there's actually a lot of questions that I think I could ask
but I'm really curious um I think it was quite nice you were so Frank about the
parts of like Gigi plot that were just like not interesting to you um and I
wanted to kind of you touched upon sort of like that period where you're really
super Hands-On with G plot to and like I yeah I was wondering if you could
just speak a bit more to like that part of the story of like you built this tool
like you clearly knew a lot about the gramar graphics you like it it feels like and this is me kind of putting my
own interpretation like you really like believed in the potential of this thing um and I I just wonder like yeah like
what was your thinking there how did you decide you know obviously to invest that
much but also then the transition out of that like what that um
kind of looked like yeah so I think there was really
um like I think the thing that really led to um ggot 2 like gig plot existing
was a combination of me like writing a lot of arode both like bass plots and L
plots to try and solve visualization problems and finding it like just having
the scent it felt harder than it should be and there was weird things that didn't feel right and then
reading um the grammar of graphics and being like like wow like this is the way
we should be thinking about Graphics like I want to go and use this now and there was like no open source
implementation of the grammar of Graphics at that time and so that really
motivated me and that was like during my PhD where I was doing consulting for a lot of other PhD students and then kind
of after that like when I joined rice and I was I was teaching like it was very like direct motivation like these
are problems that I see like I'm having that I see people having that people are struggling with like how can I like fix
those problems and I like that that's sort of all like that's what got me into it and
some sense that's that's kind of what like KN me out of it as well because
like I want to like my goal seems to be to like make data science or data
analysis easier for you and so it felt like at some point like gplot 2 was like
good enough that it was no longer the bottleneck like the bottleneck and in GP
2 kind of evolved with like tidy like co-evolved with tidyr so it's felt like oh like you know you can get the data
you can get in the right format you can actually use it with ggplot to but how do you actually get the data like into r
oh like you know sure if you've got a CSV file that's great but what if you got an Excel file well that's kind of
painful there's like nothing very like there was I think stuff that used like
Java and other things that were like painful to set up well like what if your data lives in a database like you've got
DBI but a lot of these back ends kind of work a little weird or crash or have
problems so then that really got me thinking well like what if you want to scrape you know get data from an API
scrape data from a website so that really pushed me more on like how do you get data and uh and so like I'm I'm sort
of driven by like you know like where are the hot spots where are the pain points like as you know some tool you
know as tools get better existing pain goes away and kind of new pain like
creeps up and that's sort of like one of the reasons like one of the things I've been to turning my attention to more
recently is like this this problem of like IR in production like like doing data analysis and I like
you know it's not like perfect but to me it doesn't feel like that is where the pain that like the excruciating pain for
people lies currently the pain is like you've done that analysis and now you need to run it repeatedly like on
another computer and get the reports to someone else in your organization like how do you do that and where are the the
missing pieces um so I definitely like you know have a
lot of love in my heart F too like clearly it's the thing that like I am
still most well known for I have like like a literally ridiculous number of citations
for from that um but at the same time I'm like driven
to solve this problem more broadly not just visualization and it feels great to kind of you know be able to hand off
ggot to to kind of the next generation of people to to care about it you know having this exension community is is
awesome
to June do you want to go ahead yes um I hadly uh this is a very
Q: Early design mistakes in ggplot2
specific question about something that you wrote in the extending gplot vignette like almost 10 years ago
actually uh so there's one sentence in there where you say the naming of layer construction functions used using stat
underscore and gomore was an early design mistake and that you should have called them layer underscore instead so
I'm kind of curious whether you still believed this to be the case after seeing G PL get so successful and what
you might have imagined the counterfactual world the layer underscores to look
like kind yeah I don't remember what I was thinking but I have to say like I think one of the things that feels like
a little Una feeling about the grammar is that the geoms and stats are so tightly
intertwined like by like it's not 100% true but by and large like there's a onetoone correspondence between the
geoms and the stats like sure you can use stat bin with things other than GM
histogram but kind of mapping the Aesthetics in the right way makes it makes it biddly so
that and so that that idea that like combined and and then like the position adjust is so tightly connected the the
GM right like there's only a given a specific GM there's only a few limited
set of possible position so I think like in hindsight I wouldn't have made those
quite the I mean they still probably like maybe in the internals they would
still exist but they've been by and large exposed to the user um through like a layer function so
You' call layer histogram which Maybe behind the scenes in a way that's not directly exposed to user still call you
know something that a function that does Bunning and then something that draws rectangles but just kind of that that
split of like GM and Stat kind of I don't know it sort of implies this
degree of fonality that I don't think really exists the other you know the other like
perhaps biggest was really a mistake but I guess the biggest regret with ggplot 2 was not
like discovering the pipe earlier cuz like ggplot GG plot like they happened
before ggplot 2 would have been the perfect candidate for the pipe um I don't know I don't know if many of you
seen this but I actually kind of bought ggplot back to life on my um GitHub and
I call it like gplot one obviously it wasn't actually at the time but GG plot
like work so well with the pipe and so why and like then like then like layer
is nice because it's both like a noun and a verb so you're like layering on a
histogram or layering on um a bunch of points so that I think also would have
worked really nicely with the pipe um so I think I don't know that there
may be other things like 10 years ago that I didn't like about the design but those are the things I remember today
Q: ggplot2 in teaching
Joyce do you want to go ahead sure uh first I just want to thank Hadley I mean GG plate is just such an amazing and
incredible thing and every time I teach it you it's just so exciting to think about how you have this beautiful
elegant theory of grammar of graphics and then it gets implemented and then it gets immensely popular which just
doesn't really happen that often a lot of the really popular tools are not the ones that you're so excited about so
yeah that that's amazing and um I guess it kind of leads into like I just kind of want to chime in on the discussion
about the ways that people are using the extensions in ways that weren't intended and my stake in this is from the
academic not the coding point of view in that I'm feeling pressure all the time to teach in Python you know I've held
steadfast I teach the required course on data visualization at data Science Institute Colombian and I have about 200
students a year and they learn R in my class they do everything in R and I'm not backing down but um part of the way
I sell it is the truth that there's statisticians and research involved in
every step of the way from the development of s to you having designed
G plat 2 with good defaults in mind and the research of statistical Graphics in
mind and all of that so then when they come back with all the this like weird stuff um it kind of it it definitely
detracts from that message though I understand there's not a lot that can be done about it but yeah I I and I don't
want to be you know I hate to be the police saying yeah don't use this package don't use this package I mean
it's nice when I can with GG plat 2 I can just say like whatever you do with just GG plat two is fine like there's
almost nothing I can think of few things I I do have a few issues where I want to change I suggest changing defaults but
mostly not so that's just my kind of um take on it
all yeah I mean this I feel to me like the argument that I would make about
teaching are is I really do think it gets you to like the underlying Concepts
much faster and this list kind of like programming experience you skills you
need like you can get to the data science faster um but the thing that I think is going to be interesting in
terms of like framing these discussions in the oncoming years is like LMS and I
I think like I don't 100% believe this claim but I think it's probably the
people are telling you to py to use switch to python might and that is just like the fact that like LM llms are
getting us closer and closer to this kind of universeal translation where so you wrote it in R and someone needs
it in Python like no big deal translate it um and so the language that you learn
to programming kind of matters Less in that sense so you can focus on like how
do you get the big Ideas across to the students as quickly as possible
um and I yeah I don't know I just think I don't know like when I look at what people have to do to do data data
analysis and python it just feels like I don't know it's like so much additional stuff
you've got to learn that are not not directly related to a challenge at
hand and just I don't know I think maybe the pendulum is starting to swing back away from like let's do everything in
one language towards like let's you know let's pick tools based on what they're
good at and if you have to use multiple tools then that's okay and you know again we've got llm so it's getting
easier and easier if you're confronted with something unusual language to get you know to make track to figure out
what it does to get traction to make changes even without fully understanding how it all works so I
I I don't know my kind of my sense of like how R is doing sort
of waxes and wains over time but I like it's curently like increasing I think like because of
Al interesting yeah just to be clear like I'm not like against you know it's just I tell them the master students
they learn python in their other classes they can learn R in mind and you know it's they should be able to handle it
it's not a big deal to learn another programming language like don't don't freak out about it especially especially
us since it's so designed to like pick it up and drop it pretty
e the
way well um we have we have Hassan on the call so maybe he does have um who's
Q: Translations of ggplot2 in other languages
a the plat in author so if you did have any thoughts about I don't know I guess
like to hadly um I guess I wonder how it how
um interested you are in like kind of translations of G plot 2 I think you
know plot n is one of them and I think I've seen Julia plot or I don't I don't know maybe Jun knows he's you're
following the judia world more um and like so thought on those translations um
yeah the translations of GG PL to to other languages are really interesting like I think that was something
like know 10 years ago it just felt like like someone's got to be able to do a b
GG plot to than me like in another programming language um but it just it
didn't there's nothing like know there's certainly lots of great visualization stuff but I don't think there's anything
that's quite like the step up from like lce to G or even an R like no one's come
up with something that's like dramatically better than than GP to which in some ways I'm like a
little sad about like I think it would be really like i' would love to kind of Be spooped by someone um like that and
in some sense like now I'm in like a position where if that happened i' just be like okay well we'll like hire that
person that POS it so it's not like it's a there's like any kind of competition it's like working that together and you
in many ways like that's why Hanan is at posit now like he created like the the
the you know the the best realization of ggplot 2 in Python and maybe even the
best realization of gplot that you can even do in Python given the straight constraints of the language and so I'm
you know definitely like my philosophy is like let you know let's let's all
work together on this stuff like let's let's it's not like it's not a thing where like one person has to win and
another person has to lose like we can all win by working on the stuff
together but yeah it's surpr I mean it really surprised me like I I don't know
I guess now I'm more arrogant perhaps more confident in my programming skills
but certainly like in the E days of G BL 2 it just felt like like I can't like
surely so someone has to be able to do that like better than me um but it does feel like it isn't
like I think doing a visualization like writing visualization software is challenging because it requires like
quite a few different skills like you you need the programming skills but you
also need some sense of like what are people actually doing with data you need to know a bit about like the psychology
of like vision and perception and I and I think to like for it to catch on like it has to look good
is as well so you have to be able to create something that's aesthetically pleasing just seems like a fairly like
unusual combination of of
skills um yeah everybody's reading Thomas's comment DJ plot 2 has been
Rewritten twice since released so it is not that old in reality Rejuvenation oh yeah
wonder how much of it is like we should try and find like the gplot 2 code like the oldest bit of gigot 2 code has
remained untouched there's certainly something
yeah I found recently what was that ton oh I found a
piece recently which um was commit number one where uh it was the the color
codes for the uh skill gradient two I think those have been in gplot 2 since
forever since the first commit on the repository that's interesting yeah and
that's a good that's a good example of something where I've been like at the time I felt like I made the best
decision I could based on perceptual research and I think now there are like much better color schemes we could use
there but figuring out how like how to change that without breaking maybe tens of thousands or
hundred thousands of hundreds of thousands of plot in a while this is
tough um I thought we could give Hassan a chance to speak to to to some of the
translation stuff and then we could hear from
giio if you'd like uh yeah thank you um I don't know how um my my getting into the
translations was because I had picked up um I I had picked up Python and I didn't
and and I really really really um uh wanted to find a better way to to do to
do to do visualization and uh and I just couldn't
get over um what I had seen in what I had seen in G uh in G PL 2 then I
immediately bought I bought the book and still to this day um the the Gramm of
Graphics book Remains the most expensive book I ever bought cuz shipping it to Uganda cost me 100 about over
$180 which was a lot of money like 2011 so I really B into I really bought into
the um the U uh the concept I just wasn't confident enough to see it to see
it through to to to to do it at the time until when I felt like two years later
where I was like okay I can implement this and um uh and and uh and and um and
the package that had tried to do it in Python wasn't doing a good job because they didn't care I was like okay I'm I
think I'm the best person to to to see this through and I need to and I need to
maintain ownership if this is to remain um uh true to the vision so um I never
thought about I never thought about python versus R like python versus r
that I'm doing a a trans that I am necessarily doing a translation it was just like for convenience because I
stayed away from um I didn't go with r because at the time the project I was interested in um
which was like looking at election data because I thought like okay I'll just like do this analysis stuff like once
and maybe every three or so years I'll have I'll work on a project and then like the tid of sudden developed well um
and I felt a little scripty and OD I'm like if I'm going to have to dip into the depths of this language over and
over I would have like start from scratch but if I had thought that I would pick up the bag of like you know
um looking at data and and and all that stuff because I know I would have like
okay R would become my thing and I wouldn't have to worry about picking up context and all of um all over again so
I would have like there's an hour but just because I thought like oh um I'll have to I won't be doing this
permanently I'll have to come back to um to a language and I want to look
friendly every time I I look at it so I I went I went to Python and then I got
drugged into um uh into into creating plot nine and
yeah so glad you could join today and and um
we've been in touch about maybe you giving a longer talk if you want or maybe this maybe this checks that box
for us we'll see either way um J um if you want to ask your
Q: Other implementations of grammar of graphics
question yeah I I've always thought something that's interesting about this
translations like plot n and Seaborn and tidier plots for Julia and so on that
we've been talking about is that they don't just implement the grammar of
Graphics in other languages they implement the actual literal syntax of J
blood to like the same function name uh like the same they use plus as often
right instead of so like I I've I don't
use other programming languages a lot other than R so this is not something that like dominates my every thought but
I have often wondered about this is there like a missed opportunity
here like Hadley was talking about how there was no like other thing that
came up after jigl 2 that like changed the way that we make graphics in the
same way that jigl 2 did and maybe that's because the grammar of Graphics is just like a really much better way of
thinking about Graphics but that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be other implementations of it other ways of
expressing the grammar of Graphics uh like you were talking with stats and G or what or with pipes
instead of pluses and so on right why do you think
we have so many essentially like I mean I do not
mean this in a bad way like copies of Digit platon right as opposed to
re-implementations of the grammar of Graphics so I think there are I mean
there are some like Vaga Vaga light and that kind of um genealogy of of
visualization tools on the JavaScript side which do take a somewhat different
approach I don't know like really enough about the
um JavaScript Community to kind of have a sense of like whether they've like really taken off but I I don't doesn't I
don't get the sense that they're kind of really the dominant visualization system in
JavaScript part of the problem is like ggot 2 kind of occupies a special place in R because R is really all about data
science and ggplot 2 is a really good framework for visualizing data there're like lots
and lots of other things that you want to visualize might want to visualize that gg2 is like not very good for at
all like if you're doing scientific visualization you've got like you know 4D arrays of like very very large data
sets gig 2 is not going to help you and so and then because like other
programming language communities tend to have more like diversity in the kind of
visualiz challenges that maybe there's like less room for a grammar
based um visualization framework to really
kind of become the dominant one um some of this is just like the r
Community is because it's a little bit I think smaller and more cohesive it does
tend to have more uh centralization around packages
like when you look at python like anything you can imagine doing in Python by and large it seems like there's
always like three packages that are all quite popular and you can make an argument for using any three of them
where an ah I think that happens less frequently
um so I don't know like so I don't know how much of it is because like different programming languages just said like
different communities and different that drives development in different ways um
some of it I think like ggp 2 hit I think kind of a sweet spot in terms of
getting you up and running with creating Graphics without having to learn too much of the grammar
because you can certainly swing too far towards the kind of the grammar approach where now like the first thing you have
to do before you can create a plot is learn the grammar and then that's like annoying and sure you get a bunch of
benefits in the long run but you need to deliver like benefits in the short run in order to get people to to use your
tool um so I think like you know there's a lot you know there's all all but these
things is always just a big component I think of Lock and timing and um of GG b
2 happening at the right time when data science is really like taking off so I
yeah I don't know it's an interesting question
uh yeah I would love to see something like a a grammar of graph like something
it's even better than the grammar of Graphics that would be cool but yeah I don't know I've kind of like stopped I
guess I used to kind of worry about that like the juj PO two would kind of come irrelevant and now I guess I'm worrying
worried more it's like not becoming irrelevant like what's going on like
shouldn't we have come up with something better it's been like 20 years almost 20 years people like come on like let's
let's see if we can do something better now but also I don't know like you know
software I think kind of as I get older I kind of appreciate more things that
are just like stable upon and been around for a long time and you can assume will continue to be around for a
long time so I don't know that's an interesting question I have any like good
answers I think my take on it if I may is perhaps that good ideas and good
implementations are extremely uh contagious like when when you have been
exposed to something that works really well it's very very hard to escape the
manner in which it operates because it infects your mind and how you think about the problem so um if the people
developing uh uh new plotting visualization Tools in other language
are our uses that has been like
by fortune or whatever been lured away from R and it's now like oh my God I
miss a great visualization framework and and they end up being the one de
developing it I think it's very very hard to Envision a version of the grammar of
Graphics that is not very ggplot to like not that it can't exist but it's
just the implementation has been so successful that it is just so prevailing
and it's very hot like like it the mental gestic that you have toone mind yeah
yeah those mro microchips during the co vaccinations are
actually um oh it's it the mental gymnastics that you have to do to just like be different for the sake of being
different is really hard so it's I think it's very very easy to just maybe not
copy it but be very very inspired by
it so we're coming up on an hour um but um I guess I I'll put forth a
last question which is um what are maybe some risks to consider as like
Q: Advice for new extenders
we maybe want to bring new people into the extension space like because I I think
that there is a lot of potential for more use and like the community is
becoming more mature um but you know that's um you know more reverse
dependencies for you all to manage um so
um so yeah kind of with with that in mind um you have any I wouldn't think about
as risks I would think more like I think there are a lot of opportunities for like this community to come together and
say like these are good ways to develop extensions these are the things that are going to make your extension robust and
work well for the long term and be appealing to users um I don't think you should worry
too much about the the first dependency checks again I'm not suffering the pain
from them anymore but in general like uh I don't know like Thomas and T get paid
well to suffer R reverse dependency check so you can't feel too bad for them
but I but I think like just framing it as like you know can we like can you develop like best practices can you help
people kind of help guide people down the path to success like if you do have
to use ggplot to internals like what can you do to kind of protect yourself or
what can you do to like ensure that you know change in the future is is you know
like accepting both that you're doing something that's like a little bit naughty and it might break in the future
so how are you going to like drisk that for yourself um I think then all of that
just you know helps the gg2 developers and not behold you to
Q: Encouraging best practices in ggplot2
community I jump in with a follow-up question um just a short one so I'm
really interested actually in this like idea of best practices so um I've been
sort of also in like the kind of computer science visualization um community so like I I'm
at MES in kind of very R Community um and there's like not I think this Al
speaks to the success of gplot is like people mention gplot in a lot of this
literature but like it's very clear that they haven't engaged actually deeply with any of the design Phil opy or like
any of the systematic thinking out of that but there's also not a lot of I guess academic literature or even
other literature and I guess my question is like how do we encourage this more
and like I guess as a little bit of self-promotion I I WR a blog post sort of recently about like kind of rapper
functions and like I think to Corey's question like how do we actually balance this like you want an autop plot but you
also want to like maintain the the like kind of Elegance of the grammar of Graphics how could we encourage more of
that like I just wrote it for fun basically but you know
given yeah I don't know I mean I think that's like writing blog posts like writing like getting the word on the
community I think like this you know the ggp extensions group is a great way like so much of this it's like so much easier
to keep momentum on when you're working on these kind of like best practices and guides if you can do it as a team
um so finding other people with similar interests and just like chipping away it over time I mean I you know I like the
way I always think about this is like like if you want people to do the
right thing you have to make the right thing easier than the wrong thing like
you can tell people to do the right thing and like it's as much as you want till you blown the face but that people
act in their own self-interests you know people all people it's not like people are lazy but it's not like maintaining
the art package is like at the top of most people's priority list or writing the best possible art Cod like everyone
has like other life going on so figuring out how you can help those people like save time um you know you you make the
community stronger you help them and those people you know feel grateful to you as well I think it's a really you
know virtuous cycle then some fraction of those people you know then later join to you know come back and help out the
community in turn
Closing
right well I want to be respectful of everybody's time so I think um we should
just give Hadley a big round of applause or virtual pra um and we really
appreciate you coming the conversation was great thanks Thomas for joining last minute too to give us some additional
Insight um and um correct all my mistakes [Music]
and um yeah we'll we'll see you next time I'll send out a invite for Corey's
talk and what he's doing with principal component
analysis all right great to see everybody aw thanks so much for having me it's lovely to chat with you all
thank you thank you"
