# So ggplot2...

--
#               ... what's the fuss?

# Back to ggplot2. What's the fuss?

--
Hadley Wickham, ggplot2 author on it's motivation:

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable. 

--

> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved, 

---

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just wanted to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.* 

--

> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and ... I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

# So what's the promise of ggplot2?

--

## Getting the plot form you picture in your head ...

--

## ... into reality...

--

## ... by describing it.

---

# ggplot2 is called a 'declarative' graphing system.

--

# It lets you *'speak your plot into existance'*. (Thomas Lin Pederson?) 

--

### This is fast. Because most of us, like Hadley Wickham, can **picture** the form of the plot we're going after rather clearly (i.e. what the horizontal position should represent, what color should represent, what 'marks' (points, lines) are going to appear on the plot).  
--
'Getting' our plot made becomes a matter of describing what we're already picturing!

# The "Grammar of Graphics" (1999)

```{r, out.width="40%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wilkinson_grammar_of_graphics.png")
```

---
## Sidebar/related...

### A 'grammar of graphics' also ... flexibility and creative freedom!...

### When Wilkinson describes grammar of graphics, he sells it arguing that this grammar of graphics implementations would allow "drawing every statistical graphic"

???
The grammar of graphics framework, proposed by Leland Wilkinson in 1999, that identified 'seven orthogonal components' in the creation of data visualizations.\
Wilkinson asserted that if data visualization packages were created using a separation of concerns approach -- dividing decision making surrounding these components --- the packages would be able to "draw every statistical graphic". The grammar of graphic principles were incredibly powerful and gave rise to a number of visualization platforms including Tableau, vega-lite, and ggplot2.

> #### Grammar makes language expressive. A language consisting of words and no grammar (statement = word) expresses only as many ideas as there are words. By specifying how words are combined in statements, a grammar expands a language's scope.

â€“ Wilkinson, 2005, The Grammar of Graphics, 2nd edition

### 'we wait'

### vs 'we waited'

???

just this little change puts us in a totally frame of mind!

---

# definition of a data visualization...

---


# A data visualization is made up of ...

--

### .left[... geometric objects ...]

--

### .center[...that take on aesthetics (color, line width, x-position) ...]

--

### .center[...which represent variables ...]

--

### .right[...from a dataset (dataframe)]

## Elements of the Grammar of Graphics (choices)

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wilkinson_layers_grammar_of_graphics.png")
```

---

### A series of 'grammatical' choices:

--

- declarative mood: Declare data

--

- interrogative mood: ask for representation choose aesthetic mapping (what aesthetics (color, size, position) will represent what variables)

--

- nouns: geometric objects, 'geoms' or 'marks' (tableau's vocabulary) that take on the visual attributes

--

- modifiers (adjectives, adverbs): change defaults

  - labels
  - aesthetic scales
  - coordinate system
  
--

- conditional mood: 

  - change data, aesthetic mapping, or defaults for specific geom layer
  
--

- punctuation: make decision to facet or not, breaking up your ideas
    
--

- interjections: annotation

--

- greetings: theme (plot look and feel)

### 'I'm already pro, I came for tricks and tips...'


Lots of annotation strategies (still grammatical!), that feels tricky; people love faceting with shadow data of full data...  https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about
