```


---

### A series of 'grammatical' choices:

--

- declarative mood: Declare data

--

- interrogative mood: ask for representation choose aesthetic mapping (what aesthetics (color, size, position) will represent what variables)

--

- nouns: geometric objects, 'geoms' or 'marks' (tableau's vocabulary) that take on the visual attributes

--

- modifiers (adjectives, adverbs): change defaults

  - labels
  - aesthetic scales
  - coordinate system
  
--

- conditional mood: 

  - change data, aesthetic mapping, or defaults for specific geom layer
  
--

- punctuation: make decision to facet or not, breaking up your ideas
    
--

- interjections: annotation

--

- greetings: theme (plot look and feel)

> # "the Grammar of Graphics makes everything else easy because you've just got all these, like, little nice decomposable components" -- Hadley Wickham


---

# ggplot2 is called a 'declarative' graphing system.

--

# It lets you *'speak your plot into existence'*. (Thomas Lin Pederson?) 

--

## This is fast. Because most of us, can **picture** the form of the plot we're going after rather clearly (i.e. what the horizontal position should represent, what color should represent, what 'marks' (points, lines) are going to appear on the plot).  
--
## 'Getting' our plot made becomes a matter of describing what we're already picturing!


---
# So what's the promise of ggplot2?

--

## Getting the plot form you picture in your head ...

--

## ... into reality...

--

## ... by describing it.

# The problem?

--

## Sometimes we don't have the vocabulary that's needed to 'speak' fluently.

---

## Example: adding the mean

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggxmean::geom_x_mean()
```

???
Consider for example, a the seemingly simple enterprise of adding a vertical line at the mean of x, perhaps atop a histogram or density plot.


---

`r chunk_reveal("basic", title = "### Adding the mean at x w/ base ggplot2")`

```{r basic}
airquality %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 
      mean(airquality$Ozone, 
           na.rm = T)
    ) ->
g

g %>% layer_data(i = 2) # histogram layer
```

???
Creating this plot requires greater focus on ggplot2 *syntax*, likely detracting from discussion of *the mean* that statistical instructors desire.
It may require a discussion about dollar sign syntax and how geom_vline is actually a special geom -- an annotation -- rather than being mapped to the data. None of this is relevant to the point you as an instructor aim to make: maybe that the the mean is the balancing point of the data or maybe a comment about skewness.


---

## geom_histogram()

--

## counts the number of observations in a 'bin'

--

## draws rectangles accordingly

---

### Adding the conditional means?

```{r cond_means_hard, echo = F}
airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(
    Ozone_mean = 
      mean(Ozone, na.rm = T)
    ) ->
airquality_by_month

ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month)) +
  geom_vline(data = airquality_by_month, 
             aes(xintercept = 
               Ozone_mean))
```

???
Further, for the case of adding a vertical line at the mean for different subsets of the data, a different approach is required. This enterprise may take instructor/analyst/student on an even larger detour -- possibly googling, and maybe landing on the following stack overflow page where 11,000 analytics souls (some repeats to be sure) have landed:

  geom_boxplot() ->
g
  
g %>% #BREAK
  layer_data() #BREAK

# Like histogram, geom_boxplot does lots of compute in the background

# Easy geom_*() recipes

### Using ggplot2 has been described as writing 'graphical poems'.

--

<!-- and a system that lets us 'speak our plot into existence'.  -->
### But we may feel at a loss for words when functions we'd like to have don't exist.  The ggplot2 extension system allows us to build new 'vocabulary' for fluent expression.  

--

### An exciting extension mechanism is inheriting from existing geoms.  Particularly important to statisticians and mathematicians is writing new geom_* that perform and visualize calculations.  

---

### To get your feet wet in this world and give you a taste of patterns for geom extension, we provide three *introductory* examples of the geoms_ that inherit from *existing* geoms (point, text, segment, etc) along with practice exercises.  

--

### With such geoms, calculation is done under the hood by the ggplot2 system; with these geom, you can write graphical poems with exciting new graphical 'words'! 

---

### This tutorial is intended for individuals who already have a working knowledge of the grammar of ggplot2, but may like to build a richer vocabulary for themselves.

# Recipe #1

--

##`geom_point_xy_medians()`

--

- This will be a point at the median of x and y

---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 0: use base ggplot2 to get the job done

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("penguins", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r penguins, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins <- remove_missing(penguins)

penguins %>% 
  summarize(bill_length_mm_median = median(bill_length_mm),
            bill_depth_mm_median = median(bill_depth_mm)) ->
penguins_medians

penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm) + 
  aes(y = bill_length_mm) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = penguins_medians,
    color = "red", size = 4,
             aes(x = bill_depth_mm_median,
                 y = bill_length_mm_median))
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 1: computation

--

- define computation that ggplot2 should do for you, before plotting
  - here it's computing a variable with labels for each observation
- test that functionality!

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("compute_group_xy_medians", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r compute_group_xy_medians, include = FALSE}
compute_group_xy_medians <- function(data, 
                                     scales){
  data %>% 
    summarize(x = median(x),
            y = median(y))
}

penguins %>%
  # function requires data 
  # with columns named x and y
  rename(x = bill_depth_mm, 
         y = bill_length_mm) %>%
  compute_group_xy_medians()
```


---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 2: define ggproto

--

- what's the naming convention for the proto object?
- which aesthetics are required as inputs?
- where does the function from above go?

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("StatXYMedians", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r StatXYMedians, include = FALSE}
StatXYMedians <- ggplot2::ggproto(
  `_class` = "StatXYMedians",
  `_inherit` = ggplot2::Stat,
  required_aes = c("x", "y"),
  compute_group = compute_group_xy_medians
  )
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 3: define geom_* function


--

- define the stat and geom for your layer

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("geom_point_xy_medians", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r geom_point_xy_medians, include = FALSE} 
geom_point_xy_medians <- function(
  mapping = NULL, 
  data = NULL,
  position = "identity", 
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, ...) {
  
  ggplot2::layer(
    stat = StatXYMedians, # proto object from step 2
    geom = ggplot2::GeomPoint, # inherit other behavior
    data = data, 
    mapping = mapping,
    position = position, 
    show.legend = show.legend, 
    inherit.aes = inherit.aes,
    params = list(na.rm = na.rm, ...)
  )
  
}
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center


## Step 4: Enjoy! Use your function


---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("enjoy_penguins", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r enjoy_penguins, include = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_point_xy_medians(color = "red")
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center

### And check out conditionality!

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("conditional_penguins", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r conditional_penguins, include = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm, 
      color = species)+
  geom_point()+
  geom_point_xy_medians(size = 4)
```

background-size: cover



---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Now you ...

--

### Create the function `geom_point_xy_means()`


---

Q&A:  Suggested questions.

Is ggxmean aimed at statistical classroom and MA206?

Can all new geoms be modeled after the easy geom recipes?

Why did it take you so long to figure out the extension mechanism? 

Which was the most difficult geom to build in {ggxmean}?

How long does it take to get through the 'Easy Geom Recipes' tutorial? 

Is building a package difficult?

Is maintaining a package difficult?
