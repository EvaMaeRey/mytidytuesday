# Grammar of Graphics

## Elements of the Grammar of Graphics (choices)

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*MMZuYgeC_YjXNC1r4D4sog.png")
```


---

### A series of 'grammatical' choices:

--

- declarative mood: Declare data

--

- interrogative mood: ask for representation choose aesthetic mapping (what aesthetics (color, size, position) will represent what variables)

--

- nouns: geometric objects, 'geoms' or 'marks' (tableau's vocabulary) that take on the visual attributes

--

- modifiers (adjectives, adverbs): change defaults

  - labels
  - aesthetic scales
  - coordinate system
  
--

- conditional mood: 

  - change data, aesthetic mapping, or defaults for specific geom layer
  
--

- punctuation: make decision to facet or not, breaking up your ideas
    
--

- interjections: annotation

--

- greetings: theme (plot look and feel)

> # "the Grammar of Graphics makes everything else easy because you've just got all these, like, little nice decomposable components" -- Hadley Wickham


---
# So what's the promise of ggplot2?

--

## Getting the plot form you picture in your head ...

--

## ... into reality...

--

## ... by describing it.

---

# ggplot2 is called a 'declarative' graphing system.

--

# It lets you *'speak your plot into existence'*. (Thomas Lin Pederson?) 

--

### This is fast. Because most of us, can **picture** the form of the plot we're going after rather clearly (i.e. what the horizontal position should represent, what color should represent, what 'marks' (points, lines) are going to appear on the plot).  
--
'Getting' our plot made becomes a matter of describing what we're already picturing!

---



## "Create graphical 'poems'." - Hadley Wickham

--

## 'Write statistical stories.' - Gina Reynolds



---

# The problem?

--

## Sometimes we don't have the vocabulary that's needed to 'speak' fluently.

---

## Example: adding the mean

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggxmean::geom_x_mean()
```

???
Consider for example, a the seemingly simple enterprise of adding a vertical line at the mean of x, perhaps atop a histogram or density plot.


---

`r chunk_reveal("basic", title = "### Adding the mean at x w/ base ggplot2")`

```{r basic}
airquality %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 
      mean(airquality$Ozone, 
           na.rm = T)
    ) ->
g

g %>% layer_data(i = 2) # histogram layer
```

???
Creating this plot requires greater focus on ggplot2 *syntax*, likely detracting from discussion of *the mean* that statistical instructors desire.
It may require a discussion about dollar sign syntax and how geom_vline is actually a special geom -- an annotation -- rather than being mapped to the data. None of this is relevant to the point you as an instructor aim to make: maybe that the the mean is the balancing point of the data or maybe a comment about skewness.


---

### Adding the conditional means

```{r cond_means_hard, echo = F}
airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(
    Ozone_mean = 
      mean(Ozone, na.rm = T)
    ) ->
airquality_by_month
ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month)) +
  geom_vline(data = airquality_by_month, 
             aes(xintercept = 
               Ozone_mean))
```

???
Further, for the case of adding a vertical line at the mean for different subsets of the data, a different approach is required. This enterprise may take instructor/analyst/student on an even larger detour -- possibly googling, and maybe landing on the following stack overflow page where 11,000 analytics souls (some repeats to be sure) have landed:

---

`r chunk_reveal("cond_means_hard", title = "#### Conditional means (may require a trip to stackoverflow!)")`


---


---

geom_boxplot()

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("boxplot")`

```{r boxplot, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder::gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = continent) + 
  aes(y = gdpPercap) +
  geom_boxplot() ->
g
  
g %>% 
  layer_data()
```

---

# Like histogram, geom_boxplot does lots of compute in the background

--

### lots of compute in the background

--

### built from a number of primitives

- rect
- point
- segment

--

### conceptually distinct from those components


---

ggplot2 intentionally lean for maintainance purposes...

--

but geom_x_mean() would be so nice

---

*'extending statistical geometries'*

geoms -> "nouns..."

--

Nouns that inherit from existing geometries.

---

## Hand*schuh*

--

## Nackt*schnecke*

--

## Daumen*kino*

---

Unique new concepts, but inheriting from more primitive forms (segment, point, text, etc)

geom_point*_xy_means

--

geom_coordinates (inherit from geom_text)

--

geom_segment*_residuals (inherits from segment)

--

Easy to use -- you know the grammar!

--

Not horribly to make (especially now...)
