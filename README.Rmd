# mytidytuesday git repo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mytidytuesday is to hold the little projects.  They are like blogs posts, but just code, hardly any prose.  It's in the spirit of #tidytuesday!  

```{r, results='asis', echo = F}
library(magrittr)
webpages <- fs::dir_ls(type = "file", recurse = T, glob = "*.html") %>% rev()

webpages %>%  
  paste0("- [",
         . ,
         "]",
         "(https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/", ., ")\n") %>% 
  cat()   
```
