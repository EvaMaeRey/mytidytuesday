# mytidytuesday git repo ...
 
 
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->  

The goal of mytidytuesday is to hold small projects.  They are like blogs posts, but mostly code.  In the spirit of #tidytuesday no pressure to write prose!  

Initially, I planned to work on #tidytuesday stuff, but I ended up just working on problems that arose in my work.

```{r, results='asis', echo = F}
library(magrittr)
webpages <- fs::dir_ls(type = "file", recurse = T, glob = "*.html") %>% rev()
       
webpages %>%     
  paste0("- [",
         . ,
         "]",
         "(https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/", ., ")\n") %>% 
  cat()     
```



```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_experiment <- function(name){
  
  dir.create(paste0(Sys.Date(),"-", name), recursive = F)
  # rmarkdown::html_document()
  
} 

new_experiment("ggedges2plot")


```
