# The repo is just a bunch of experiments...

The goal of mytidytuesday is to hold small projects.  They are like blogs posts, but mostly code.  In the spirit of #tidytuesday no pressure to write prose!  

Initially, I planned to work on #tidytuesday stuff, but I ended up just working on problems that arose in my work and personal interests.  

```{r, results='asis', echo = F}
library(magrittr)
webpages <- fs::dir_ls(type = "file", 
                       recurse = T, 
                       glob = "*.html|*.pdf") %>% 
  rev()

file_name_wo_extension <- webpages %>% 
  stringr::str_remove(".html|.pdf")

webpages %>%    
  paste0("1. [",
         . ,
         "]",
         "(https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/", ., 
         ") **[source](https://github.com/evamaerey/mytidytuesday/blob/master/",
         file_name_wo_extension,".Rmd",
         ")**\n") %>% 
  cat()     
```
 
 


  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_experiment_rmd <- function(name){
  
  dir <- paste0(Sys.Date(),"-", name)
  
  dir.create(dir, recursive = F)
  
  filepath <- paste0(dir, "/", name, ".Rmd")
  
  readLines("experiment-template.Rmd") |> 
    writeLines(filepath)

}   

  
new_experiment_rmd(name = "webr")


```
