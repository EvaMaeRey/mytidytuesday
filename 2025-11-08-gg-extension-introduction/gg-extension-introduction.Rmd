## Intro Thoughts

The concept of 'a grammar of graphics' in a book by [description] Leland Wilkinson that envisions data visualization systems (2000).   The book identifies independent components of data visualizations and advocates for systems that allows for relatively more independent declaration of components.  It describes how graphical components can be combine to specify familiar or new graph types. 

ggplot2 in the R programming language (2010) is a notable implementation of the ideas elaborated in Wilkinson's book, created by Hadley Wickham, allows plot components to be written down in code.  

Grammar of Graphics implementations like ggplot2 allows users to specify data visualization components independently.


In 2015, extension mechanism were introduced which allowed R package developers to create components that could be used with existing functionality from 'base' ggplot2.
