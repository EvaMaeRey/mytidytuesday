Chapter 1: Explain your plot bit by bit is empathetic (Matt Blackwell; Hans Rosling)
Chapter 2: Pair up your code and plot is empathetic (Garrick Aden-Bui, others)
Chapter 3: Automating builds is self empathy (Emi Tanaka; Garrick Aden-Bui; Me)

--

Next Chapter: chunk_reveal_live()... Keeping it short and making it easy and personal/situated is empathetic.  (Kelly Bodwin; Me)

--

Another Chapter:  Flipbookr for quarto: Keeping it up-to-date is empathetic (Kieran Healey; Kelly Bodwin; me?)

## Origins in presentation and *empathy* for your audience in presentation...



---

## you are practicing empathy by using data visualization (it's fast); gonna make seeing patterns in your data feel effortless

John Tukey quote...

--

## but you can encode so much in a data viz.  So you really need to talk about that encoding step by step, else the interpretation is lost.

Not me: 'Wow, that is profoundly empathetic'. ðŸ¦‰ðŸ¦‰ðŸ¦‰

Me: 'Neat-o! That sounds a lot like the *layered* presentation of graphics.'  ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“

## We get the 'Hans Rosling' speak-it experience ...

--
## ... because ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, (gg = grammar of graphics) ...

--
## ... which breaks up the plot elements into *orthogonal* parts ...

--
## ... and allows user to manipulate those parts bit by bit.

## Leland Wilkinson identified orthogonal elements in 'The Grammar of Graphics'. Wilkinson on the Policy Viz Podcast [here](https://policyviz.com/podcast/episode-201-leland-wilkinson/).
