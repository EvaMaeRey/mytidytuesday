# flipbookr: An unfolding tale about empathy...


---

## Chapter 1: Explaining your plot bit by bit is empathetic (Matt Blackwell; Hans Rosling)

--
## Chapter 2: Pair up code and plot components is empathetic (Hadley Wickham)

--
## Chapter 3: *showing* this pairing is gentle and empathetic (Garrick Aden-Bui, others)

---

Automating pairing is self-empathetic (Emi Tanaka; Garrick Aden-Bui; Me)

---

## Next Chapter: chunk_reveal_live()... Making it accessible and relevant is empathetic.  (via Kelly Bodwin; rstudioapi; Me)

---

## Yet another Chapter:  Flipbookr for quarto: Keeping it up-to-date is empathetic (Kieran Healey; Kelly Bodwin; me?)

## Origins in presentation and *empathy* for your audience in presentation...


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My best tip on how to give better quantitative presentations is to (a) use more plots and (b) build up your plots on multiple overlays, as in:<br><br>- Just x-axis (explain it)<br>- Add y-axis (explain it)<br>- Add 1 data point (explain it)<br>- Plot the rest of the data (explain it)</p>&mdash; Matt Blackwell (@matt_blackwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_blackwell/status/991004129198854145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## you are practicing empathy by using data visualization (it's fast); gonna make seeing patterns in your data feel effortless

--

Visual information channels are "preattentively processed" -- Cleveland and McGill 1984

"preattentively processed" == effortlessness

--

John Tukey quote

--

---

## but you can encode so much in a data viz.  So you really need to talk about *each* encoding (one by one) else the interpretation is lost.

## Not me: 'Wow, that is profoundly empathetic'. ðŸ¦‰ðŸ¦‰ðŸ¦‰

## Me: 'Neat-o! That sounds a lot like the *layered* presentation of graphics.'  ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“

Hadley Wickham, ggplot2 author on it's motivation:

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable.

--
> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved,

---

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just wanted to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.*

--
> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and ... I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

## Leland Wilkinson identified orthogonal elements in 'The Grammar of Graphics'. Wilkinson on the Policy Viz Podcast [here](https://policyviz.com/podcast/episode-201-leland-wilkinson/).

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, out.width="75%"}

# and pair coding

`r chunk_reveal("pairing", break_type = "replace", replace = '20', replacements = 1:10, display_type = "output", title = "### Unpaired pipeline_steps & graphical_elements")`

```{r pairing, include = F}
tibble(function_name = paste0("ggplot2 func '", LETTERS[1:10],"'"),
  gg_element = paste("gg manipulation", 1:10))[1:20,]
```

---

Usual pairing? 

--

Pipeline

--

Final output

---

### Complete code pipeline

```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("scatter"), eval = F}

```

---

### Complete code pipeline

```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("scatter"), eval = F}

```

### Complete plot


```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("scatter"), eval = T, echo = F, out.height="50%"}

```

---

### Possible pairings of functions and gg graphical moves.

```{r, echo = F}
tibble(function_name = paste0("ggplot2 func '", LETTERS[1:10],"'")) %>% 
         crossing(gg_element = paste("gg manipulation", 1:10)) %>% 
  mutate(combo = function_name %>%  paste(gg_element, sep = "->\n")) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = runif(100), y = runif(100)) + 
  geom_label(aes(label = combo)) 
```

---

# flipbook pairing is tidy, like vectors in a data frame...

---


`r chunk_reveal("babynamesvectors")`

```{r babynamesvectors, include = F}
babynames::babynames$name[1:10]

babynames::babynames$n[1:10]

# better when paired...
babynames::babynames %>% select(name, n) %>% .[1:10,]

```
