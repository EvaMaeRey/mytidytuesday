```{r, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = "", cache = F)

# R packages are composed of many files. 

--

# These multiple, un-ordered constituents oftene fail to yield a clear big-picture package narrative.

---

# But greater 'narrative arc' could be preserved/created by using a single meta-document to manage constituent files and their content.

--

# Such a document could tell the story of motivations for the package and speak to how all the components relate. 

---

# Recent initiatives include helper packages {litr}, {fusen}, and {readme2pkg}.

--

# readme2pkg proposes the *README.Rmd* to be used as this control file.  

---

# Supporting functionality includes:

# `readme2pkg::chunk_to_dir()`

## usage:


#### `chunk_to_dir(chunk_name = "my_function",  dir = "R/")`




---

#  readme2pkg dependencies:

# - knitr (knit)
# - rstudioapi (live session use of chunk_to_dir; via flair - Kelly Bodwin)
# - stringr


---

## The workflow also assumes use of a template, that prompts users through devtools and usethis package building functions

https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template

---


```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template")
```

---


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("template_screenshot.png")

```








---


The template breaks down package building into phases:

- Part 1. Goals definition; what package functionality should deliver

- Part 2. Construct functions and a minimal viable package

- Part 3. Listen and iterate; (soliciting feedback)

- Part 4. Refine and make robust

- Part 5. Spread the good news; seek a wider audience

- Part 6. Commit.  Share on CRAN or R-Universe


---

Template walk through...

## github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template



---

# Part of the readme2pkg philosophy is that there are many reasonable pausing, stopping, and even ditch-the-project points along this progression, and the workshop will try to highlight those.  


---

## readme2pkg sees readme as:

1. a point of entry for new comers to development (readme template can be used as a getting started template)

--

2. checklist for more seasoned developers

--

3. As a package story board, 

--

4. Centralized contributor meeting place (facilitates pointing potential contributors...)

# Summary:



The intent of [{readme2pkg}](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg) is to let you build quick packages right from a README.Rmd. The function readme2pkg::chunk_to_dir (and friends) lets you send code chunk contents to a new file in a sub-directory. This means you don‚Äôt have to manage a bunch of function files that constitute a package - at least in the early stages.  Instead you can work with them in your README.Rmd.

--

Also, the [EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template) repo on github is a template repository meant to complement the readme2pkg workflow. Using the README.Rmd in the template, you can populate the sections with your material (introduction and functions, etc). And this README template contains a ‚Äòliving‚Äô checklist that will help you get through the steps of creating a package, including building the file architecture, licensing, documentation, and builds. The checklist items are run through {devtools} and {usethis} packages. Code is included that lets you ‚Äòcheck-off‚Äô the items as you run the code.

# Pkg building workshop w/ readme2pkg... 

If we had time for a demo, I hope to get through function documentation (adding a roxygen skeleton) in Part 3 of the readme2pkg.template.

# Mini workshop requirements

A. Installed Packages: 

  - on CRAN: `usethis`; `devtools`; `ggplot2` or `stringr` (depending on worked example below)
  - on Github: `remotes::install_github("EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg")`
  
B. Template repo: [EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template) 

C. Github account linked to RStudio

### Option 1:  {redhistogram} package

The goal of {redhistogram} is to make ... easier.


Without the package, we live in the effort-ful world that follows üèã:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = dist)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "red")
```

  
With the {redhistogram} package, we'll live in a different world (ü¶Ñ ü¶Ñ ü¶Ñ) where the task is a snap ü´∞: 

Proposed API:

```

library(redhistogram)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = dist)) + 
  geom_histogram_red()

```



# Part I. Work out functionality  ‚úÖ 

Here is a function that will do some work...


```{r geom_histogram_red}
library(ggplot2)
geom_histogram_red <- function(...){
  
  geom_histogram(fill = "red", ...)
  
}
```


## Try it out

```{r}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = dist)) + 
  geom_histogram_red()
```




### Option 2:  {ind.recode} package (based on real-life [{ind2cat}]()). 

The goal of {ind.recode} is to make ... easier.


Without the package, we live in the effort-ful world that follows üèã:

```{r}
december_grad <- c(1,1,1,0)

cat_december_grad <- ifelse(december_grad, 
                            "december grad",
                            "not december grad")
```

  
With the {ind.recode} package, we'll live in a different world (ü¶Ñ ü¶Ñ ü¶Ñ) where the task is a snap ü´∞: 

Proposed API:

```

library(ind.recode)

december_grad <- c(1,1,1,0)

cat_december_grad <- ind.recode::ind_recode(x = december_grad)

```



# Part I. Work out functionality  ‚úÖ 

Here is a function that will do some work...


```{r ind_recode}
library(stringr)
ind_recode <- function(x){
  
  cat_true <- deparse(substitute(x)) |> 
      str_replace_all("_", " ")
  
  cat_false <- paste("not", cat_true)
  
  factor(x, labels = c(cat_false, cat_true))
  
}
```


## Try it out

```{r}
december_grad <- c(1,1,1,0)
ind_recode(december_grad)
```
