# Use *visual channels* to communicated information

- consumed "pre-attentive processing" (McGill and Cleveland)

What are the variables that are represented in the data vizualization?

--

What are the *aesthetics* (visual channels) are used to represent variables?

# The "Grammar of Graphics" - 1999 

```{r, out.width="40%"}
# knitr::include_graphics("images_for_lecture/wilkinson_grammar_of_graphics.png")
```

## Elements of the Grammar of Graphics (choices)

```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics("images_for_lecture/wilkinson_layers_grammar_of_graphics.png")
```

---

### A series of choices:

- choose data
--

- choose aesthetic mapping (what aesthetics will represent what variables)

--
- choose geometric objects

--
- make decision to facet or not

--
- make choice to summarize data or not (statistics)

--
- choose a coordinate system

--
- make thematic choices
