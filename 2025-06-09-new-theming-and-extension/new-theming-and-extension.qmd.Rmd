TLDR:  The next release of ggplot2 theming is something to be excited for!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F)
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
```

`paper`, `ink` and `accent` arguments and `geom_*()`s that are responsive to 

A ton of value is delivered to analysts in the form of not needed to worry about fiddly details when it comes to adhering to brand theme -- enabling more focus on analysis and interpretation. 

To that end two transformative innovations are coming to ggplot2's theming system!

1. New arguments to convenience themes...

2. 



, having layers (geom_ and stat_) that are responsive to theme has long been on the agenda of ggplot2 authors and maintainers.

With the creative vision of PR # and release ggplot2_3.5.2.9000 it's nearly here!  

Now, geom_ and stat_ layers should automatically take on the look and feel of your theme! 

And ggplot2 theme convenience functions expose new arguments `paper`, `ink`, and even `accent` (geom_smooth's color) so changing the look and feel of your plot has never been easier.

  paste(knitr::knit(text = text, quiet = F), collapse = "\n")

  
} 

# chunk_return_two_col("bchalk")
# chunk_name =  "bchalk"
```

## Using our chalkboard brand theme

`r chunk_return_two_col("bchalk")`

```{r bchalk, include = F}
library(tidyverse)

theme_chalkboard <- theme_classic(base_size = 20,
         paper = "darkseagreen",
         ink = alpha("lightyellow", .8),
         accent = "orange")

theme_chalkboard |> 
  theme_set()

ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter with loess smoothing")
```



`r chunk_return_two_col("hello")`

```{r hello, include=F}
theme_blackboard <- theme_grey(base_size = 10,
         paper = "grey20",
         ink = alpha("whitesmoke", .8),
         accent = "magenta3")

theme_blackboard |> 
  theme_set()

ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter with loess smoothing")
```

# What if my favorite geom_*() extension isn't up-to-date with geom theming?

One unfortunate downside is that layer extensions that involve the creation of new Geom ggproto objects, with new default_aes defined are likely to fail to shine as brightly amid the glamour that the new changes bring.

`r chunk_return_two_col("textpath")`

```{r textpath, include = F}
theme_chalkboard |> 
  theme_set() 

three_countries <- gapminder::gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("Netherlands",
                        "Belgium",
                        "Denmark"))

ggplot(data = three_countries) + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath()
```


`r chunk_return_two_col("textpath2")`

```{r textpath2}
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(data = three_countries) + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath(
    color = get_theme()$geom$ink, #<< work around
    )
```




```{r}
theme_tiny <- theme_classic(base_size = 7)



gapminder::gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("Netherlands",
                        "Belgium",
                        "Denmark")) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath(
    size = theme_tiny$geom$fontsize, #<< work around
    linewidth = theme_tiny$geom$linewidth
    ) +
  theme_tiny

```



Suppose you have created StatChull from the ggplot2 extension vignette, and have also created the modified GeomPolygon

```{r}
library(dplyr)
compute_group_chull <- function(data, scales){
  
  chull_indices <- chull(x = data$x, y = data$y)
  
  data |> 
    slice(chull_indices)
  
}

StatChull <- ggproto(`_class` = "StatChull",
                     `_inherit` = Stat,
                     required_aes = c("x", "y"),
                     compute_group = compute_group_chull)

ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = drat, y = wt) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_polygon(stat = StatChull)
```



# Inherit default aes for Geoms from base ggplot2 Geoms


```{}



```


# Modified 



```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

library(ggram)
ggram:::clearhistory()

p1 <- ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point() +

  labs(title = "Scatter with Loess")
#
brand_theme1 <- theme_grey(base_size = 15,
         paper = "darkseagreen",
         ink = alpha("lightyellow", .8),
         accent = "orange")

brand_theme2 <- theme_grey(base_size = 10,
         paper = "grey20",
         ink = alpha("whitesmoke", .8),
