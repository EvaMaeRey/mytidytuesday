TLDR: The next release of ggplot2's theming is something to be excited for!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F)
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
```

A ton of value is delivered to analysts in the form of not needed to worry about fiddly details when it comes to adhering to brand theme -- enabling more focus on analysis and interpretation.

To that end transformative innovations are coming to ggplot2's theming system:  (thanks to the creative vision of PR \# and release ggplot2_3.5.2.9000 it's nearly here!
)  We'll look at two of them, and then implications for ggplot2 extension.

1.  It's never been easier to change the look and feel of your plot, as  `paper`, `ink` and `accent` color governing arguments have been added to convenience functions like `theme_grey()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_minimal()` etc.

2.  Now ggplot2's `geom_*()`s (and `stat_*()`s)  are responsive to theme! Now, geom\_ and stat\_ layers should automatically take on the look and feel of your theme!


```{r, echo = F}
two_columns <- 
':::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="3%"}
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
\n```{r code-chunk_name, code = knitr::knit_code$get("chunk_name"), eval = F}
\n```
:::
::: {.column width="1%"}
:::
::: {.column width="41%"}
\n```{r output-chunk_name,, code = knitr::knit_code$get("chunk_name"), echo = F}
\n```
:::
::::
'


the_code <- "hi"


chunk_return_two_col <- function(chunk_name = "chunk_name"){
  
  text = two_columns |> stringr::str_replace_all("chunk_name", chunk_name) 
  
  paste(knitr::knit(text = text, quiet = F), collapse = "\n")

  
} 

# chunk_return_two_col("bchalk")
# chunk_name =  "bchalk"
```

## Radical changes to plot look and theme from convenience functions  `theme_grey()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_minimal()` etc.

Let's see how new arguments  `paper`, `ink` and `accent` as well as old stalwarts `base_size` and `base_family`, can dramatically change the look and feel of your plot.

In example A. we make and use the `theme_chalkboard` -- a modification of `theme_classic`. In example B. we make and use the `theme_whitesmoke` -- a modification of `theme_classic`.

### Example A. `theme_chalkboard`

`r chunk_return_two_col("bchalk")`

```{r bchalk, include = F}
library(tidyverse)

# 1. define theme from convenience 
# functions theme_grey, theme_classic
# theme_bw, etc.
theme_chalkboard <- theme_classic(
         base_size = 20,
         paper = "darkseagreen",
         ink = alpha("lightyellow", .8),
         accent = "orange")

# 2. Set theme
theme_chalkboard |> 
  theme_set()

# 3. Get plotting!
ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  aes(x = cut) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Example B. `theme_whitesmoke`

`r chunk_return_two_col("hello")`

```{r hello, include=F}
# 1. define theme
theme_whitesmoke <- theme_bw(
         base_size = 18,
         base_family = "Times",
         paper = "whitesmoke",
         ink = "gray20",
         accent = "magenta4")

# 2. set theme
theme_whitesmoke |> 
  theme_set()

# 3. Get plotting!
ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  aes(x = cut) + 
  geom_bar()
```

# What if my favorite geom\_\*() extension isn't up-to-date with dynamic layer theming? How do I keep the chart to come into line with theme?

One unfortunate downside is that layer extensions that involve the creation of new Geom ggproto objects, with new default_aes defined are likely to fail to shine as brightly amid the glamour that the new changes bring.

### Problem: ggextension::geom\_\*() doesn't dynamically theme.

As we see below 

`r chunk_return_two_col("textpath")`

```{r textpath, include = F}
theme_chalkboard |> 
  theme_set() 

two_countries <- gapminder::gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("Netherlands",
                        "Belgium"))

# Uh-oh!  geom_textpath ...
ggplot(data = two_countries) + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath()
```

### Solution: Override with set colors/sizes etc.

`r chunk_return_two_col("textpath-override")`

```{r textpath-override, include = F}
# Set defaults manually
ggplot(data = two_countries) + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath(
    color = "lightyellow",
    size = 5
  )
```

### A more dynamic solution: use `theme_*$geom$ink`, `theme_*$geom$fontsize` and friends for more harmonious look

`r chunk_return_two_col("textpath2")`

```{r textpath2, include=F}
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
ggplot(data = two_countries) + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath(
    # set color, size from theme
    color = theme_chalkboard$geom$ink, 
    size = theme_chalkboard$geom$fontsize
    )
```

### An even more dynamic solution: use `get_theme()$geom$ink`

Should you anticipate a possible change-up of your theme, you might use `get_theme()` instead of the name of the theme in the formulation above. 

`r chunk_return_two_col("textpath3")`

```{r textpath3, include=F}
theme_whitesmoke |> 
  theme_set()

get_theme()$geom$ink

ggplot(data = two_countries) + 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = lifeExp,
      label = country) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textpath(
    # set color, size from theme
    color = get_theme()$geom$ink, 
    size = get_theme()$geom$fontsize
    )

```

# Notes for Extenders on layered themes!

There's great news for extensions that define new layers that use Geoms from 'base' ggplot2 lock stock and barrel - the dynamism will carry through to your layers if the new version of ggplot2 is loaded.

However, if you've created your own Geom object, you may have hard-coded default aesthetics. Color may be "black" and fill may be some shade of gray. This is modeled in the ggplot2 extension vignette geom_chull() example. Let's have a look at that.

### Your Geom may have hardcoded default aesthetics

Suppose you have created StatChull from the ggplot2 extension vignette, and have also created the modified GeomPolygon

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
# 1. Define compute
compute_group_chull <- function(data,
                                scales){
  
  row_num_convex_hull_members <- 
    chull(x = data$x, y = data$y)
  
  data |> 
    slice(row_num_convex_hull_members)
  
}

# 2. Define Stat
StatChull <- ggproto(
  `_class` = "StatChull",
  `_inherit` = Stat,
  required_aes = c("x", "y"),
  compute_group = compute_group_chull
  )
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
# 3. Define Geom: Modified GeomPolygon
GeomPolygonHollow <- 
  ggproto("GeomPolygonHollow",
          GeomPolygon, 
          default_aes = 
            aes(colour = "black", 
                fill = NA, 
                linewidth = 0.5, 
                linetype = 1, 
                alpha = NA)
          )

# 4. Test Geom X Stat w/ theme
theme_chalkboard |> 
  theme_set()

ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = drat, y = wt) + 
  geom_point() +
  layer(stat = StatChull,
        geom = GeomPolygonHollow,
        position = position_identity())
```
:::
:::

```{r statchull, echo = F}
# Use geom_*() X Stat w/ theme
theme_chalkboard |> 
  theme_set()

ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = drat, y = wt) + 
  geom_point() +
  layer(stat = StatChull,
        geom = GeomPolygonHollow,
        position = position_identity())
```


But, if we look at the definition of GeomPolygon in the latest ggplot2 development version, we see default aesthetics are no longer hardcoded, which is what allows our layers to be themed. 

```{r}
GeomPolygon$default_aes
```


### Use modifyList to piggy back on default aesthetics of  'base' ggplot2 Geoms, and get dynamism for free (also will be backward compatible!). 

For extenders, there are a few ways to update Geom default aes so that they take on characteristics specified by theme.

```{r}
# 1. determine aesthetics that need defaults
GeomPolygon$default_aes

# Update create GeomPolygonHollow to have 
# GeomLine defaults and fill = NA
GeomPolygonHollow <- 
  ggproto(`_class` = "GeomPolygonHollow",
          `_inherit` = GeomPolygon, 
          default_aes = 
            GeomPolygon$default_aes |>
              modifyList(GeomLine$default_aes) |>
              modifyList(aes(fill = NA))
          )

# 2. inspect newly defined aesthetics
GeomPolygonHollow$default_aes

# 3. Try out GeomPolygonHollow
ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = drat, 
      y = wt) + 
  geom_point() +
  layer(stat = StatChull,
        geom = GeomPolygonHollow,
        position = "identity")
```
