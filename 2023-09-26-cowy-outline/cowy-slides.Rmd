# Skip at COWY: discussing origins of ggplot2

Hadley Wickham, ggplot2 author on it's motivation:

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable.

--
> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved,

---

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just wanted to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.*

--
> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and ... I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

# But... sometimes there are limits to what we can express


---
class: inverse, center, middle

# The problem?

--

## Sometimes we don't have the vocabulary that's needed to 'speak' fluently.

---

## Example

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggxmean::geom_x_mean()
```

???
Consider for example, a the seemingly simple enterprise of adding a vertical line at the mean of x, perhaps atop a histogram or density plot.


---

`r chunk_reveal("basic", title = "### What's the *base* ggplot2 experience")`

```{r basic}
airquality %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 
      mean(airquality$Ozone, 
           na.rm = T)
    ) ->
g
```

???
Creating this plot requires greater focus on ggplot2 *syntax*, likely detracting from discussion of *the mean* that statistical instructors desire.
It may require a discussion about dollar sign syntax and how geom_vline is actually a special geom -- an annotation -- rather than being mapped to the data. None of this is relevant to the point you as an instructor aim to make: maybe that the the mean is the balancing point of the data or maybe a comment about skewness.



---

### Adding the conditional means?

```{r cond_means_hard, echo = F}
airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(
    Ozone_mean = 
      mean(Ozone, na.rm = T)
    ) ->
airquality_by_month

ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month)) +
  geom_vline(data = airquality_by_month, 
             aes(xintercept = 
               Ozone_mean))
```

???

Further, for the case of adding a vertical line at the mean for different subsets of the data, a different approach is required. This enterprise may take instructor/analyst/student on an even larger detour -- possibly googling, and maybe landing on the following stack overflow page where 11,000 analytics souls (some repeats to be sure) have landed:

---

`r chunk_reveal("cond_means_hard", title = "#### Conditional means (may require a trip to stackoverflow!)")`



---

# Why is geom_smooth() is so easy, and my mean of x line is so hard?

--

### Like geom_smooth does a bunch of compute in the background

--

### then uses geometric primitives

- line
- ribbon

--

### geom_x_mean() doesn't exist.


--

### conceptually distinct from those components

---

## ggplot2 intentionally lean for maintenance purposes.

--

## ... but geom_x_mean() would be so nice!

---

## ggplot2 extensions system exists...

--

## thus, {ggxmean} r package https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggxmean, that gives us geom_x_mean(), and ~ 25 more geoms...



---

## Examples from ggxmean

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("ols")`

```{r ols, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggxmean)
#library(transformr) might help w/ animate

## basic example code
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed,
      y = dist) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggxmean::geom_lm() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_residuals(linetype = "dashed") +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_fitted(
    color = "goldenrod3",
    size = 3) +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_conf_int() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_pred_int() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_formula() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_intercept(color = "red",
                             size = 5) +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_intercept_label(
    size = 3,
    hjust = 0)

# Thesis of the talk:

--

# Extension system is really cool.  

--

# Really powerful.

--

# Next: Saggeringly under-utilized.

---

# Under-utilized by whom? 
--
Who could find it extremely useful and could flourish in this extension space?  
--

## ggplot2 super users...
## 
## - know the grammar. 
## - know how to write functions
## - know R/ggplot2 extremely well..

# What's the barrier?


---

## The problems for a 'new wave' (quoting ggtrace author June Choe*)... 

--

### 0) 'users aren't developers'

--

### 1) 'scary ggproto methods' (less experience with OOP) 

--

### 2) hard to reason about the big chunk of codes that defined a new ggroto object  

--

### 3) even if we master all of this, then we have to become package developers? 

--

* Extender friend, without whose support *sine qua non*, and winner of ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics student paper award: https://yjunechoe.github.io/static/papers/Choe_2022_SublayerGG.pdf 

--

June's thesis: users can use ggplot2 more powerfully and dynamically on the user side with greater knowledge of delayed aesthetic evaluation?

```{r out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/easy-geom-recipes/raw/main/survey_results_summary_files/figure-html/q13_oop_experience-1.png")
```


---

## 0) Users are leaving too much on the table not to get into ggplot2 extensions - foregoing super-fluid ggplot2 experiences that extension affords

--

## 1) deemphasize OOP ggproto methods

--

## 2) pull computation out of ggproto method, to facilitate reasoning, debugging

--

## 3) build communities of support, and also support developer activities like package building


---


# *Easy geom recipes*: practice with `compute_group`
# Under construction: *More easy geom recipes*: practice with `compute_panel`

# 'And it was that easy. And I felt empowered as a result of that....' 

--

# 'But you know, like, my problem isn't gonna be that easy.'

## Sometimes it might that easy

--

## Sometimes it won't...

---

## More support: ggplot2 extenders virtual micro meeting. Support group. https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club

---

## Another problem: once you get your extension working,

--

## you will want to share with the world.

## And then you'll really be in 'scary developer territory'.
