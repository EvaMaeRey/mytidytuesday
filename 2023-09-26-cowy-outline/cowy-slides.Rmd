# Skip at COWY: discussing origins of ggplot2

Hadley Wickham, ggplot2 author on it's motivation:

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable.

--
> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved,

---

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just wanted to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.*

--
> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and ... I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

# But... sometimes there are limits to what we can express


---
class: inverse, center, middle

# The problem? (Limitations)

--

## Sometimes we don't have the vocabulary that's needed to 'speak' fluently.

---

## Example

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggxmean::geom_x_mean()
```

???
Consider for example, a the seemingly simple enterprise of adding a vertical line at the mean of x, perhaps atop a histogram or density plot.


---

`r chunk_reveal("basic", title = "### What's the *base* ggplot2 experience")`

```{r basic}
airquality %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 
      mean(airquality$Ozone, 
           na.rm = T)
    ) ->
g
```

???
Creating this plot requires greater focus on ggplot2 *syntax*, likely detracting from discussion of *the mean* that statistical instructors desire.
It may require a discussion about dollar sign syntax and how geom_vline is actually a special geom -- an annotation -- rather than being mapped to the data. None of this is relevant to the point you as an instructor aim to make: maybe that the the mean is the balancing point of the data or maybe a comment about skewness.



---

### Adding the conditional means?

```{r cond_means_hard, echo = F}
airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(
    Ozone_mean = 
      mean(Ozone, na.rm = T)
    ) ->
airquality_by_month

ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month)) +
  geom_vline(data = airquality_by_month, 
             aes(xintercept = 
               Ozone_mean))
```

???

Further, for the case of adding a vertical line at the mean for different subsets of the data, a different approach is required. This enterprise may take instructor/analyst/student on an even larger detour -- possibly googling, and maybe landing on the following stack overflow page where 11,000 analytics souls (some repeats to be sure) have landed:

---

`r chunk_reveal("cond_means_hard", title = "#### Conditional means (may require a trip to stackoverflow!)")`



---

Why is geom_smooth() is so easy, and my mean of x line is so hard?


---

# Like geom_smooth does a bunch of compute in the background

--

### built from a number of primitives

- line
- ribbon

--

### conceptually distinct from those components

---

## ggplot2 intentionally lean for maintenance purposes.

--

## ... but geom_x_mean() would be so nice!

---

## ggplot2 extensions system exists...

--

## thus, {ggxmean} r package https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggxmean, that gives us geom_x_mean(), and ~ 25 more geoms...



---

## Examples from ggxmean

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("ols")`

```{r ols, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggxmean)
#library(transformr) might help w/ animate

## basic example code
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed,
      y = dist) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggxmean::geom_lm() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_residuals(linetype = "dashed") +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_fitted(
    color = "goldenrod3",
    size = 3) +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_conf_int() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_pred_int() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_formula() +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_intercept(color = "red",
                             size = 5) +
  ggxmean::geom_lm_intercept_label(
    size = 3,
    hjust = 0)
```

## The problems for a 'new wave' (quoting ggtrace author June Choe*)... 

--

### 0) 'users aren't developers'

--

### 1) 'scary ggproto methods' (less experience with OOP) 

--

### 2) hard to reason about the big chunk of codes that defined a new ggroto object  

--

### 3) even if we master all of this, then we have to become package developers?

# Tutorial assessment

Most participants indicated the tutorial taking them a short amount of time.  Six of nine said that on average, each of the recipes took less than 15 minutes to complete.  The remaining three participants responded that the recipes took between 15 and 30 minutes on average. 


![](../../easy-geom-recipes/survey_results_summary_files/figure-html/q16tutorial_time_taken-1.png)

The first prompt `geom_point_xy_means` exercise was completed by all participants; and all but one completed the `geom_text_coordinates()` exercise.  Several participants failed complete the last recipe (residuals).

### Using ggplot2 has been described as writing 'graphical poems'.

--

<!-- and a system that lets us 'speak our plot into existence'.  -->
### But we may feel at a loss for words when functions we'd like to have don't exist.  The ggplot2 extension system allows us to build new 'vocabulary' for fluent expression.  

--

### An exciting extension mechanism is inheriting from existing geoms.  Particularly important to statisticians and mathematicians is writing new geom_* that perform and visualize calculations.  

---

### To get your feet wet in this world and give you a taste of patterns for geom extension, we provide three *introductory* examples of the geoms_ that inherit from *existing* geoms (point, text, segment, etc) along with practice exercises.  

--

### With such geoms, calculation is done under the hood by the ggplot2 system; with these geom, you can write graphical poems with exciting new graphical 'words'! 

---

### This tutorial is intended for individuals who already have a working knowledge of the grammar of ggplot2, but may like to build a richer vocabulary for themselves.

# Recipe #1

--

##`geom_point_xy_medians()`

--

- This will be a point at the median of x and y

---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 0: use base ggplot2 to get the job done

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("penguins", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r penguins, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins <- remove_missing(penguins)

penguins %>% 
  summarize(bill_length_mm_median = median(bill_length_mm),
            bill_depth_mm_median = median(bill_depth_mm)) ->
penguins_medians

penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm) + 
  aes(y = bill_length_mm) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = penguins_medians,
    color = "red", size = 4,
             aes(x = bill_depth_mm_median,
                 y = bill_length_mm_median))
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 1: computation

--

- define computation that ggplot2 should do for you, before plotting
  - here it's computing a variable with labels for each observation
- test that functionality!

---




```{r compute_group_xy_medians, include = T}
compute_group_xy_medians <- function(data, 
                                     scales){
  data %>% 
    summarize(x = median(x),
            y = median(y))
}

penguins %>%
  rename(x = bill_depth_mm, 
         y = bill_length_mm) %>%
  compute_group_xy_medians()
```


---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 2: define ggproto

--

- ## what's the naming convention for the ggproto object?
- ## which aesthetics are required as inputs?
- ## where does the function from above go?

---




```{r StatXYMedians, include = T}
StatXYMedians <- ggplot2::ggproto(
  `_class` = "StatXYMedians",
  `_inherit` = ggplot2::Stat,
  required_aes = c("x", "y"),
  compute_group = compute_group_xy_medians
  )
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center

## Step 3: define geom_* function


--

- define the stat and geom for your layer

---




```{r geom_point_xy_medians, include = T}
geom_point_xy_medians <- function(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, ...) {

  ggplot2::layer(
    stat = StatXYMedians, # proto object from step 2
    geom = ggplot2::GeomPoint, # inherit other behavior
    data = data,
    mapping = mapping,
    position = position,
    show.legend = show.legend,
    inherit.aes = inherit.aes,
    params = list(na.rm = na.rm, ...)
  )

}
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center


## Step 4: Enjoy! Use your function


---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("enjoy_penguins", left_assign = "detect")`


```{r enjoy_penguins, include = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
      y = bill_length_mm) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point_xy_medians(
    size = 8,
    color = "red")
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center

### And check out conditionality!

---


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("conditional_penguins", left_assign = "detect", break_type = 1)`


```{r conditional_penguins, include = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
      y = bill_length_mm,
      color = species) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  geom_point_xy_medians(size = 8)
```

## Intro Thoughts

- ggplot2 lets you speak plots into existence

- this allows for some powerful data viz and statistical story telling, build up your plot bit by bit...

- just like rock star Hans Rosling...

- and more (geom_smooth)

- except you will run into a wall... where you don't have the vocab.

- promise is ggplot2 extension... (vignette, Thomas Pederson)

- but you may run into a wall... because you don't have the background to translate this stuff to action

- OOP, holding all the pieces together, inability to practice demonstrated mechanisms.

- New approach for 'a new wave of ggplot2 extenders'...

- extension-ready population; ggplot2 super-users

- easy geom recipes

- population description

- results

- 'It's not gonna be that easy'

- support group

- 'so now I need to write a package...? and test and message?'

- ggtedious


The problems for the 'new wave' quoting June bunch... 0. 'users aren't developers' 1) 'scary ggproto methods' (less experience with oop) 2) hard to reason about the big chunk of codes that defined a new ggroto object  3) even if we master all of this, then we have to become package developers?

My proposed solutions, promoting 'easy geom recipes',  0) maybe users have got no choice but to be developers, because 0a. they are sick of precalculation that ggplot2 can just do and 0.b want the mental match of geom_x_mean() and the vline mean appears and 0c. ggplot2 base can't be responsible for working on all my unique problems. 1) make ggproto as ignorable as possible at first. 2) pull out all the pieces that define the ggproto and handle separately. 3) work on package development best practices: https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggtedious - this is where I'm definitely currently failing and know it. I never formally test anything.
