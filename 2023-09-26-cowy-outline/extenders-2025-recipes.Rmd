## my experience with learning extension

### When did my ggplot2 life begin?

--

### Summer 2017, Started using ggplot2 in 'Zurich Summer School for Women in Political Methodology ...' ggplot2 workshop run by **Denise Traber**

--

### 'Makeover Monday' (Tableau community's TidyTuesday) **Eva Murry** and **Andy Krebel**, Heard about on Data Stories, A podcast on data visualization with **Enrico Bertini** and **Moritz Stefaner**

Hadley Wickham, on it's motivation:

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable.

--
> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved,

---

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just wanted to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.*

--
> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and ... I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

## Taught Intro Stats w/ tidyverse/ggplot2 in Dresden and Denver (2018-2020)


--


## And started to feel a little bit of pain even with ggplot2. 

--

## Sometimes we don't have the vocabulary that's needed to keep 'speaking' fluently.

---

## Example: What's the graphical poem here? 

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggxmean::geom_x_mean()
```

???
Consider for example, a the seemingly simple enterprise of adding a vertical line at the mean of x, perhaps atop a histogram or density plot.


---

`r chunk_reveal("basic", title = "### What's the *base* ggplot2 experience")`

```{r basic}
airquality %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 
      mean(airquality$Ozone, 
           na.rm = T)
    ) ->
g
```

???
Creating this plot requires greater focus on ggplot2 *syntax*, likely detracting from discussion of *the mean* that statistical instructors desire.
It may require a discussion about dollar sign syntax and how geom_vline is actually a special geom -- an annotation -- rather than being mapped to the data. None of this is relevant to the point you as an instructor aim to make: maybe that the the mean is the balancing point of the data or maybe a comment about skewness.



---

### Adding the conditional means?

```{r cond_means_hard, echo = F}
airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(
    Ozone_mean = 
      mean(Ozone, na.rm = T)
    ) ->
airquality_by_month

ggplot(airquality) + 
  aes(x = Ozone) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month)) +
  geom_vline(data = airquality_by_month, 
             aes(xintercept = 
               Ozone_mean))
```

???

Further, for the case of adding a vertical line at the mean for different subsets of the data, a different approach is required. This enterprise may take instructor/analyst/student on an even larger detour -- possibly googling, and maybe landing on the following stack overflow page where 11,000 analytics souls (some repeats to be sure) have landed:

---

`r chunk_reveal("cond_means_hard", title = "#### Conditional means (may require a trip to stackoverflow!)")`



---

# Why is geom_smooth() is so easy, and my mean of x line is so hard?

Fall 2021 Independent studies... https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ay_2022_2_advanced_individual_study-

- `geom_high_leverage` Morgan 
- `geom_high_influence` Madison


---

## Spring 2022 independent study: make a tutorial. 

### w/ Morgan: 'a no-struggle introduction to layer extension, for unsophisticated ggplot2 users'

---

## 3 examples, 3 exercises, 3 objectives:

--

## - 1. Learn how to prepare compute for group-wise computation in a layer

--

## - 2. Learn how to define a Stat (and test)

--

## - 3. Learn how to combine a Stat and Geom into a user-facing function

---

## How to make it easy?

## - easy, familiar (boring) compute

--

## - step-by-step 

--

## - pre step (Step 0) - connect it to what you know (get the job done with base ggplot2)

---

# Stat-based geom_*() functions is focus.  Why?

## - Stats are easy*


--

## - `geoms_\*()`s are familiar

--

* relatively easy compared to Geoms and position...

---

# Stat-based geom_*() functions is focus.  Why?


#### > I've used ggplot for a very long time... Conceptually I get \[the difference between `stat_*()` functions and `geom_()*`s functions.\] But... I would not put `+ stat_*()` anything. That's not something I would naturally do after using the gg platform... for 10 years.

---

## In 2023, survey, focus group about bare-bones, download a .Rmd

--

## 2024 Moved to webr/quarto, added explanation (I didn't really have much vocabulary in 2023!)

--

## May 2025 survey + focus group...

## Now 'easy geom recipes' X July 2025 release


---

# In next ggplot2 release

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
StatMedians <- ggproto("StatMedians", Stat)
```

---

> #### 'take care to match the argument order and naming used in the ggplot2’s constructors so you don’t surprise your users.'

--

#### Writing user-facing function will get so easy! (and maybe a little more mysterious...)

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
stat_medians <- make_constructor(StatMedians, geom = "point")
geom_medians <- make_constructor(GeomPoint, stat = "medians")

geom_medians
```

### Also,

### 'I've opened a PR for adding a 'manual' stat, where essentially the compute_group() method is available to the user.

### ggplot2 4.0.0 Epilogue: our vline at mean of x motivating example w/ ggplot2 4.0.0 stat_manual... Not bad!

```{r, echo = T, fig.show="hold", out.width="25%"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality) +
  aes(x = Ozone) +
  geom_histogram() +
  stat_manual(geom = GeomVline,
              fun = ~ summarize(.x, xintercept = mean(x, na.rm = T)))

last_plot() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month))
```

---

## Willing to type a tad more: `geom_xmean` 'easy recipes approach' X ggplot2 4.0.0's make_constructor()?

```{r, fig.show="hold"}
compute_means <- function(data, scales){
  data |> summarise(xintercept = mean(x, na.rm = T)) 
}

StatXmean <- ggproto("StatXmean", 
                     Stat, 
                     compute_group = compute_means, 
                     required_aes = "x")

geom_xmean <- make_constructor(GeomVline, stat = StatXmean)
```

---

# --> the ggplot2 experience!

```{r, out.width="25%", echo= T, fig.show='hold'}
ggplot(airquality) +
  aes(x = Ozone) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_xmean() #<<

last_plot() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month))
```


---

## But, stat_manual made me feel I should cover more territory (lest you ask why do I need the recipes, I can get everything done w/ stat_manual)

--

So now there are 4 recipes, where compute_panel is introduced (not just compute_group) in recipe 2 and used in 3 and 4. 

---

New questions...

## Are `compute_panel` recipes they still accessible, interesting enough, correct?

--

## Do you still feel motivated by `compute_group` Stat example given stat_manual?


---

> # It was that easy. And I felt empowered as a result of that…. But you know, like, my problem isn’t gonna be that easy.



---


>  Wait, why did we do a Stat and not a Geom like, like ... the tutorial starts with, you're gonna make a geom_*() but I made a stat_*().


---

> **Participant H** I just think that it's weird to have two things that live at the \[same level\], because ultimately they all filter down to layer. And it's really a layer that you're creating.

---

> **Participant D** There's a sense in which also, like, you feel that maybe everything should just be 'layer\_'. But the problem is that nobody actually does that in practice. And so, you know, you would be teaching something, and it would be kind of a ggplot variant that nobody else really uses.
