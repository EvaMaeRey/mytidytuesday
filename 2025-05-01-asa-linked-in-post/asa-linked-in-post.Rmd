'Everday ggplot2 extension (or how to extend ggplot2 while drowning)' 😅 ... reflects on the of taking on extension when the rest of life is coming at in full force!  This was the the alternative title of my talk at the ASA-COWY talk last Friday. 

It is always a *great* pleasure to attend the ASA CO-WY chapter meeting.  Last week's spring meeting was *no* exception!  

I had the privilege of presenting in the mix of a *diverse* and *engaging* set of talks .

My presentation is in an area that has been called 'still somewhat niche' - ggplot2 extension!  

I talked about the *great* promise of extension 📊, but also the associated costs.😭  Even those that are well versed in extension have noted: 'ggplot2 extension is *not* for the faint-hearted'.  

My talk focused on an experimental 'express' methodology for extension - a technique that would allow practitioners to sketch out layers (geom_s and stat_s) using *much less* scaffolding code that is otherwise required. 



I look forward to keeping up with this group!
