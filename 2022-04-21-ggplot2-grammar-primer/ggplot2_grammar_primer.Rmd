# So ggplot2...

# But wait.

First one step back. 

--
# Data viz ...

--

# ... what's the fuss?

#  Function of Data Viz:

> # The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device - Tukey



---

# Use *visual channels* to represent/communicate information

## *"pre-attentive processing"* - Cleveland and McGill, 1984


---

### Key Aesthetics:


```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/aesthetic_mapping_files/figure-html/common-aesthetics-1.png")
```

from Claus Wilke's fundamentals of data visualization https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/

---

###  *Patterns* are identified with visual 'pre-attentive processing' 

--

### Uber-fast identification of relationships that you might never see in tabular form

---

# So what's the promise of ggplot2?

--

> ### And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable. 

--

> ### And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be. Like, there's a lot of custom programming involved, 

--

> ### where I just felt, like, to me, I just want them to say, like, you know, *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.* 

---

> ### ... and I'd also been reading about the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, I got to meet him a couple of times and that really kind of, I was, like, this book has been, like, written for me.

# So what's the promise of ggplot2?

--

## Getting the plot form you picture in your head ...

--

## ... into reality...

--

## ... by describing it.

---

## ggplot2 is called a 'declarative' graphing system.

--

# 'speak your plot into existance'. (Thomas Lin Pederson?) 

--

### This is fast. Because most of us, like Hadley Wickham, can conceive of the form of the plot we're going after very clearly!

# The "Grammar of Graphics" (1999)

## Sidebar/related...

### A 'grammar of graphics' also ... flexibility and creative freedom!...

### Wilkinson... this grammar of graphics implementations would allow "drawing every statistical graphic"

???
The grammar of graphics framework, proposed by Leland Wilkinson in 1999, that identified 'seven orthogonal components' in the creation of data visualizations.\
Wilkinson asserted that if data visualization packages were created using a separation of concerns approach -- dividing decision making surrounding these components --- the packages would be able to "draw every statistical graphic". The grammar of graphic principles were incredibly powerful and gave rise to a number of visualization platforms including Tableau, vega-lite, and ggplot2.

But the focus of this talk is ... 'speaking your plot into existance'

## How does Hans Rosling (2010) 'Speak his chart into existence? 

--

### ...help from BBC/Adobe After Effects/data viz Team

---

## How can we 'Speak our chart into existance?'

### ggplot2!  or another implementation of the grammar of graphics...

---

# Implementations


## Tableau 

### Polaris -> Tableau - Acquired for 15.7 Billion dollars (salesforce)

--

## Vega Lite... (dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers)


--

## ggplot2 (in R)

--

## plot9
(python's ggplot2)

## altair (python declarative newcomer) https://youtu.be/FytuB8nFHPQ?t=1382

---

## So learning the grammar/syntax... 

--

### I remember in my English/Arabic/Spanish/German/Chinese classes, that Grammar lessons just suck!

--

> #### Grammar makes language expressive. A language consisting of words and no grammar (statement = word) expresses only as many ideas as there are words. By specifying how words are combined in statements, a grammar expands a language's scope.

â€“ Wilkinson, 2005, The Grammar of Graphics, 2nd edition

### 'we wait'

--

### vs 'we waited'

???

just this little change puts us in a totally frame of mind!

---

# definition of a data visualization...

---


# A data visualization is made up of ...

--

### .left[... geometric objects ...]

--

### .center[...that take on aesthetics (color, line width, x-position) ...]

--

### .center[...which represent variables ...]

--

### .right[...from a dataset (dataframe)]




---

## Elements of the Grammar of Graphics (choices)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../../../teaching/lecture_topics/images_for_lecture/wilkinson_layers_grammar_of_graphics.png")
```

---

### A series of choices (declarations):


- choose data
--

- choose aesthetic mapping (what aesthetics will represent what variables)

--

- choose geometric objects

--
- make decision to facet or not

--
- make choice to summarize data or not (statistics)

--
- choose a coordinate system

--
- make thematic choices

# You're writing 'graphical poems' ...

--

... The paper concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ''poems''. -- Hadley Wickham Hadley Wickham, 2010 'A layered grammar of graphics.'  Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics

--

# ... do a poetry slam, every time!

---


# Slide with unsubstantiated claims about language learning needing repetition and 'out loud' practice. 

---


# What do I mean in ggplot2?

- try to decompose the plot as much as possible
- each decision gets a (+)
- don't worry about being repetitive
- name your parameters 



---

What are the variables that are represented in the data visualization?

--

What are the *aesthetics* (visual channels) are used to represent variables?

--

What are the aesthetic mappings (variable  <-> aesthetic pairings)
