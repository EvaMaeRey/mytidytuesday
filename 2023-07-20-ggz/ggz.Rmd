## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
# look at a window of 
z <- 3
tolerance <- .7
mtcars %>% 
  filter(drat < z + tolerance & drat > z - tolerance) %>% 
  mutate(closeness = (tolerance - abs(z- drat))/tolerance) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(wt, qsec, alpha = closeness) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = paste0("z = ", z,"; tolerance = ",  tolerance))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
