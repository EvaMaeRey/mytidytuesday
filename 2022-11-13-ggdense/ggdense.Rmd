## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
spotify_songs <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')
```

## Including Plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
spotify_songs %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = danceability, y = valence) + 
  geom_point()

library(tidyverse)
spotify_songs %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = danceability, y = valence) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .04) + 
  geom_point(data = . %>% sample_frac(.03)) # exemplars

library(tidyverse)
spotify_songs %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = danceability, y = valence) + 
  ggpointdensity::geom_pointdensity() +  
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```
