# Hi!

--

This 'minimal flipbook' template has a couple of classic examples to get you building your first flipbooks!

--

flipbooks are code-movies.  The frames of the movies are slides. Here we use the R package {xaringan} to create a remark.js slideshow. 

--

Slide breaks are indicated with `---` (be careful trailing white space is not allowed)

--

flipbookr's `chunk_reveal()` disassembles a single code chunk and creates the "build" of multiple partial-code chunks on different slides (the --- is automatically generated for you too).  

--

We use `chunk_reveal()` it 'inline', not in a code chunk. 

--

Let's start!

class: inverse, middle, center


# First up: classic flipbook, using defaults to walk through code pipeline





<!-- get a flipbook version of the my_cars code chunk - pauses are where parentheses are balanced -->
---


```{r my_cars, include = FALSE}
cars %>%
  filter(speed > 4) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) + #BREAK
  aes(y = dist) + #BREAK
  geom_point(
    alpha = .8, 
    color = "blue" 
    ) + 
  aes(size = speed) #BREAK
```

```{r, echo = F}
flipbookr:::chunk_reveal2("my_cars") %>% cat()
```


---
class: inverse, center, middle


# Next up:  refer to same chunk, but use user defined breakpoints, and display output only






<!-- get another flipbook version of the my_cars code chunk, this time at the defined breaks and only showing output -->
---

`r chunk_reveal("my_cars", break_type = "user", display_type = "output", title = "### user defined break! using #BREAK message")`



---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Next up:  cycle through different lines of code





<!-- get flipbook that rotates through lines, my_fill -->
---

`r chunk_reveal("my_fill", break_type = "rotate", widths = c(1,1), title = "### cycle through lines of code marked #ROTATE")`

```{r my_fill, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = cars) +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(size = 8,
             shape = 21,
             alpha = .9,
             color = "snow") +
  aes(fill = speed) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma") + #ROTATE
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "cividis") + #ROTATE
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") #ROTATE
```





<!-- adjust font size in this css code chunk, currently 80 -->

```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}

@media print {
  .has-continuation {
    display: block;
  }
}

code.r.hljs.remark-code{
  position: relative;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}


code.r.hljs.remark-code:hover{
  overflow-x:visible;
  width: 500px;
  border-style: solid;
}
```
