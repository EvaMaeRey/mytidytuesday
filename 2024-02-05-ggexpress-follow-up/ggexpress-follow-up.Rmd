## TL&DR

Abbreviated syntax for layers that employ new computations (via Stat), is probably useful. Mostly, I've looked at Elio C.'s work in a 2018 blog post. Some pretty plots were made - step-by-step of detrending! 

## gg express? why an abbreviated syntax for new layers where computation is performed under the hood...

[ggtemp/ggexpress](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggtemp) project exists because syntax to define a new layer with new compute seems a little more verbose and not proportionate to what you are trying to accomplish.  It would be nice to have some friendly within-script routine that doesn't consume 15 lines of code.  New layer functions, e.g. geom_xmean, can make plotting code more succinct and readable; but right now this might be at the price of new Stat definition code.

I've learned other people think would be nice to have short-cut syntax to layer creation, and have worked on this problem, including Elio Campitelli who writes about his similar motivation (June Choe referred me): 

> But still, creating a geom from scratch is an involved process that doesnâ€™t lend itself to simple transformations. -- Elio Campitelli  

The Spanish is slightly different, and maybe a little more to the point and from the gut: 

> Pero aÃºn asÃ­, hacer un stat especÃ­fico cada vez que uno quiere hacer un plot en particular es demasiado complicado.*

I worked with Elio Campitelli's proposed stat_rasa() below - it is very nice.  

It seems very similar to the ggtemp goals, and several decisions are the same like default geom is point, default position is identity. I think ggtemp might be coming from something that looks more like the full, standard extension syntax, and then maybe you'd be more positioned to migrate to that.  Maybe.  stat_rasa's approach feels safer, because you aren't creating new proto object on the fly within a function.  Switching out which function to call *within* a ggproto object is something that is done in a lot of other contexts. 

Elio's StatRasa serves the case where computation happens group-wise.  With define_layer_temp(), I'd started with compute_panel definition (just because of the motivating computation) and expanded back to compute_group.  A general solution (w/ compute_layer too) or split would be good; like there could be a stat_rasa_group(), stat_rasa_panel(), stat_rasa_layer() for example. 

I also heard about https://github.com/mjskay/ggbuilder from June Choe and think that is about even stat definitions within the plot build?  I have given this less attention. So I'm not sure.

I also include some code Teun Van Der Brand offered on piping, but to be honest, practical implications and connection to this problem are not yet clear to me. ðŸ˜­

Progessing with ggtemp::define_layer_temp(), I tried to make some changes to make the internal code more compact... but I think (hope) my ggplot2::Stat knowledge is failing me, and hope there is a solution.  I want to make all the relevant ggproto slots accesible, setting NULL as default, and then filling them in with Stat$compute_group and the like if the user doesn't define the slot.  The StatRasa implementation blog example has the function working for compute_group only, whereas I think there would be a lot of use cases for the function that works in compute_panel arena. 

I worked on a project with ggtemp and it was fun!  I think more fun than it would have been w/ traditional syntax. https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggcircleof5ths  We feed in a data frame contain a variable 'chord', which contains the progression F, A, Bb and Bbm, and *see* the harmonic moves being made! Which are discussed in https://switchedonpop.com/episodes/olivia-rodrigo-guts-vampire-bad-idea-right.  Here, we're looking at the out-of-key use of A chord instead of Am (in the key of F), and chromaticism and creepyness is introduced.  Its followed by the Bb to Bbm change - more chromaticism - and to sad minor key!  

```{r, eval = F}
tibble::tribble(~ lyric, ~chord, 
"Hate to give ... ", "F",
"...now, How's ...", "A",
"-bout? Just   ...", "Bb",
"...you, cool guy,", "Bbm") |>
  ggplot() + 
    aes(x0 = 0, 
        y0 = 0, 
        chord = chord) + 
    geom_chord_cof(r = .45, key = "F") + 
    coord_equal() +
  facet_wrap(~fct_inorder(lyric %>% str_wrap(25)), nrow = 1) +
    labs(title = "Vampire (& Creep) chord progression")

### Backend rewrite attempt..

This is giving me more problems; I thought I would be able to start with a lot of null elements, and use generic slot fillers like ggplot2::Stat$compute_panel... But strategy doesn't seem to be working.

  data = NULL,
  position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, 
  ...) {

  StatEmpty <- ggproto(
  `_class` = "StatEmpty",
  `_inherit` = ggplot2::Stat)
  
  if(is.null(compute_group)){compute_group <- ggplot2::StatEmpty$compute_group}
  if(is.null(compute_panel)){compute_panel <- ggplot2::StatEmpty$compute_panel}
  if(is.null(required_aes)) {required_aes  <- ggplot2::StatEmpty$required_aes}
     
     
StatTemp <- ggproto(
  `_class` = "StatTemp",
  `_inherit` = ggplot2::Stat,
  compute_group = compute_group,
  compute_panel = compute_panel,
  required_aes  = required_aes
  )
  
  ggplot2::layer(
    stat = StatTemp,  # proto object from Step 2
    geom = geom,  # inherit other behavior
    data = data,
    mapping = mapping,
    position = position,
    show.legend = show.legend,
    inherit.aes = inherit.aes,
    params = list(na.rm = na.rm, ...)
  )
}

    summarize(x = mean(x),

## On the fly Stat mutation?

  geom_boxplot() +
  plot_data() |>
    dplyr::filter(condition %in% c("B", "C")) |>
    dplyr::group_by(condition) |>
    dplyr::slice_max(response) |>
    geom_("label", aes(label = response))
```
